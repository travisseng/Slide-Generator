 # **Calculation**


"Calculating 35mm Equivalent Focal Length"

The formula to calculate 35mm equivalent focal length is:

(camera sensor size in mm x crop factor) / 100 = 35mm equivalent focal length

For example, if we have a camera with an APS-C sensor (16.7mm x 24mm):

(16.7 x 24) / 100 = 22.5mm

So the 35mm equivalent focal length for an APS-C camera is approximately 22.5mm.

 # Depth of Field Equivalent

"Calculating Depth of Field Equivalent"

The formula to calculate depth of field equivalent is:

(35mm equivalent focal length x aperture) / (sensor size in mm^2) = depth of field equivalent

For example, if we have a camera with an APS-C sensor and an 18mm lens:

((18 x 22.5) x f/2.8) / (24 x 24) = 3.39 meters

So the depth of field equivalent for an 18mm lens on an APS-C camera is approximately 3.39 meters.

 # Conversions


"Converting between Camera Formats"

Here is a list of common camera formats and their corresponding 35mm equivalent focal lengths:
- Full-frame: 24 x 36 = 864mm (equivalent to 35mm)
- APS-C: 16.7 x 24 = 22.5mm (equivalent to 35mm)
- Micro Four Thirds: 13.2 x 18 = 19.2mm (equivalent to 35mm)

To convert from one format to another, we can use the following formula:

(camera sensor size in mm x crop factor) / 100 = 35mm equivalent focal length

For example, to convert an APS-C camera to full-frame, we would multiply the sensor size by 1.6 (the crop factor for APS-C):

(24 x 1.6) / 100 = 35.7mm

So the 35mm equivalent focal length for an APS-C camera is approximately 35.7mm.
