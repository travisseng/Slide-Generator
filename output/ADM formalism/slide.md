 # _ADM formalism_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Overview

- Introduction to the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) formalism
- A framework for describing general relativity in terms of a Riemannian metric and a vector field

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Notation

- Greek letters: $\gamma$ (Christoffel symbols), $\eta$ (metric tensor), $g$ (determinant of the metric tensor)
- Latin letters: $N$ (Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector), $S$ (shift vector), $V$ (velocity vector)

 # Derivation
- Start with the Einstein field equations in their most general form
- Introduce the ADM triplet ($N$, $S$, $V$) to describe the gravitational field
- Derive the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Lagrangian Formulation
- Introduce the ADM Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$
- Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for the ADM triplet
- Show how the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are obtained as a Legendre transform of the Lagrangian

 # Equations of Motion

- Present the equations of motion for the ADM triplet in terms of the Christoffel symbols $\gamma$
- Derive the wave equation for the scalar lapse function $N$ and the vectorial shift vector $S$
