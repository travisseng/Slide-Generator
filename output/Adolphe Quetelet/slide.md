 # Social Physics
- Quetelet's work on social physics was based on the idea that social phenomena can be understood through mathematical modeling
- He developed a set of equations that he believed could explain the behavior of large groups of people
- This approach was groundbreaking at the time and laid the foundation for modern social sciences such as sociology and criminology
