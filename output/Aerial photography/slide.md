 # Types of Aerial Photography

- Oblique aerial photography: taken at an angle, providing a more detailed view of a subject
- Vertical aerial photography: taken straight down, providing a clear view of a large area
- Combined aerial photography: combines oblique and vertical images to provide a comprehensive view of a subject

 # **Orthophotomap**
- A type of aerial photograph that has been georeferenced and rectified to create a seamless, accurate image of the Earth's surface
- Used for land use planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response

 # Leaf-off or Leaf-on Aerial Photography
- Leaf-off aerial photography is taken during the dormant season, providing a clear view of the landscape without foliage
- Leaf-on aerial photography is taken during the growing season, providing a more detailed view of vegetation and land use


---
