 # **Aharonov–Bohm effect**

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Significance
- The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is a quantum phenomenon that demonstrates the importance of electromagnetic fields in the behavior of charged particles.
- It has far-reaching implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics, field theory, and the nature of reality.

 # Potentials vs. Fields
- The AB effect shows that the electromagnetic potential, rather than the electric and magnetic fields themselves, is the fundamental entity that governs the behavior of charged particles.
- This challenges our classical intuition and emphasizes the importance of considering the full quantum mechanical context.

 # Global Action vs. Local Forces

- The AB effect demonstrates that the electromagnetic force acting on a charged particle is not just a local phenomenon, but rather a global one, depending on the entire electromagnetic potential.
- This has implications for our understanding of the nature of space and time, as well as the relationship between local and global properties.

 # Locality of Electromagnetic Effects
- The AB effect highlights the non-local nature of quantum mechanics, where the electromagnetic field can be affected by charges at distant locations.
- This challenges our classical intuition and emphasizes the importance of considering the full quantum mechanical context.
