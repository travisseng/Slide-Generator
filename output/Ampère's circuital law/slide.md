 # Ampère's circuital law

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Introduction_
- Ampère's circuital law is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism that describes the relationship between electric currents and the magnetic fields they generate.
- The law was first formulated by André-Marie Ampère in the early 19th century, and has since been widely used in the study of electrical engineering and technology.

 # _Maxwell's Original Circuital Law_

- Maxwell's original circuital law states that the magnetic field around a closed loop of wire is directly proportional to the current flowing through the loop.
- The law was formulated by James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-19th century, and is based on the idea that electric currents create magnetic fields.

 # Equivalent Forms
- Ampère's circuital law has several equivalent forms, each of which describes the relationship between electric currents and magnetic fields in a slightly different way.
- These equivalent forms include the loop equation, the differential equation, and the integral form.

 # **Explanation**
- Ampère's circuital law states that the magnetic field around a closed loop of wire is directly proportional to the current flowing through the loop.
- The law is based on the idea that electric currents create magnetic fields, and is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.

 # Ambiguities and Sign Conventions
- Ampère's circuital law can be ambiguous due to the presence of both magnetic field and current vectors.
- It is important to use consistent sign conventions when applying the law, to ensure accurate results.

 # _Free Current versus Bound Current_
- In some cases, the current flowing through a loop may be "free" (i.e., not tied to any particular charge), while in other cases it may be "bound" (i.e., tied to a specific charge).
- The distinction between free and bound currents is important when applying Ampère's circuital law.

 # **Shortcomings of the Original Formulation**

- The original formulation of Ampère's circuital law has several shortcomings, including its inability to handle displacement currents and its lack of a clear physical interpretation.

 # Displacement Current
- Displacement current is a type of electric current that arises due to changes in the electric field, rather than due to movement of charges.
- The concept of displacement current was introduced by Maxwell, and is an important aspect of electromagnetic theory.

 # Extending the Original Law: the Ampère-Maxwell Equation

- The Ampère-Maxwell equation is a generalization of Ampère's circuital law that includes displacement current and describes the relationship between electric currents and magnetic fields in a more complete and accurate way.
- The equation is based on the idea that electric currents create both bound and displacement magnetic fields.

 # Proof of Equivalence
- The Ampère-Maxwell equation can be derived from Maxwell's original circuital law, and the two laws are equivalent in the sense that they describe the same physical phenomena.
- However, the Ampère-Maxwell equation provides a more complete and accurate description of electromagnetic phenomena.

 # Ampère's Circuital Law in CGS Units
- Ampère's circuital law can be expressed in terms of the centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system of units, which is a more intuitive and practical system for many applications.
- The law takes the form: ∇ x B = μ₀ J, where ∇ x B is the magnetic flux through a closed loop, B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the magnetic constant (also known as the permeability of free space), and J is the current density.
