 # Ampère's law

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction
- Maxwell's original circuital law: Gauss's law for electric fields and Faraday's law of induction
- Equivalent forms: Ampère's law and the Lorentz force law


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Explanation

- Electric current as a flow of charge
- Magnetic field as a result of moving charges
- Ampère's law relates the magnetic field to the current

 # Ambiguities and sign conventions
- Definition of the right-hand rule
- Sign conventions for current and magnetic field

 # **Free current versus bound current**

- Free current: current flowing through a conductor without any external influence
- Bound current: current flowing through a conductor with an external magnetic field

 # Shortcomings of the original formulation of the circuital law

- Does not account for displacement currents
- Assumes a fixed reference frame

 # _Displacement current_

- Caused by changes in the electric field
- Described by the displacement current equation: ∇ x E = ∂E/∂t

 # Extending the original law: the Ampère–Maxwell equation

- Combines Ampère's law and the displacement current equation
- Provides a more complete description of electric currents and magnetic fields

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Proof of equivalence
- The Ampère–Maxwell equation is equivalent to the original formulation of Ampère's law
- This is proven using the Lorentz force law and the definition of the electric field

 # _Ampère's circuital law in cgs units_

- The original formulation of Ampère's law is given in SI units
- Here, we present the law in cgs units for convenience
