 # Apsidal precession

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction

- Apsidal precession is a phenomenon in which the apsidal line of a planet's orbit (the point where the planet's distance from the sun is maximum or minimum) slowly changes over time due to gravitational forces.
- This presentation will cover the history of apsidal precession, how it is calculated, and its effects on long-term climate.

 # _History_

- Apsidal precession was first observed by French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, who discovered that Mercury's perihelion (the point where the planet is closest to the sun) was not stationary, but instead shifted over time.
- Since then, apsidal precession has been observed in many other planets and astronomical bodies, including Venus, Earth, Mars, and even some asteroids.

 # Calculation

- To calculate the rate of apsidal precession, we need to know the mass of the planet, its distance from the sun, and the gravitational constant (G).
- The rate of precession can be calculated using Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation.
- The formula for the rate of apsidal precession is:

ω = (4π²G/c^2) \* (m/r)^3

where ω is the rate of precession in radians per year, G is the gravitational constant, m is the mass of the planet, r is the distance from the sun, and c is the speed of light.

- In his work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", Isaac Newton derived a theorem that describes the motion of objects in revolving orbits.
- The theorem states that the centripetal force (the force that keeps an object moving in a circular path) is proportional to the square of the velocity of the object.
- This theorem is essential for understanding the behavior of planets and other celestial bodies in their orbits around the sun.

 # General Relativity
- General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century.
- According to this theory, gravity is not a force, but instead it is the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.
- The effects of apsidal precession can be understood through the lens of general relativity, which provides a more complete and accurate description of the gravitational forces at play.

 # Long-term Climate
- Apsidal precession has important implications for long-term climate on Earth.
- As the apsidal line changes over time, the distance between the Earth and the sun varies, leading to changes in the amount of solar energy received by the planet.
- These changes can have significant effects on global temperatures and climate patterns over thousands of years.

 # Notes
- Apsidal precession is a subtle but important phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of celestial mechanics and long-term climate.
- The study of apsidal precession has led to significant advances in our understanding of the universe and has helped us refine our theories of gravity and planetary motion.
