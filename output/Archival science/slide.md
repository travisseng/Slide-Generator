 # Archival science

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Background

- Definition of archival science: the study of the collection, description, preservation, and access of records and artifacts of enduring historical, cultural, or evidential value
- Also known as "archivistics" or "archival studies"

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _History_
- Early archives were royal or religious collections dating back to ancient civilizations (e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphics, Roman archives)
- Modern archival practices began to take shape in the 19th century with the development of professional organizations and standards for preserving records

 # Critical Archival Studies

- A critical approach to archival science that examines the power dynamics and biases present in the creation, collection, and preservation of historical records
- Critical archival studies seeks to uncover and challenge dominant narratives and perspectives in the archive

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Standards**

- Professional standards for archival practice, such as those set by the Society of American Archivists (SAA), help ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of historical records
- Standards cover areas such as description, arrangement, and processing of archival materials

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Provenance in Archival Science

- Provenance refers to the origin and history of an object or document, including its creator, custodial history, and other contextual information
- Understanding provenance is crucial for assessing the authenticity and reliability of historical records

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # The Principle of Provenance

- The principle of provenance states that the origins and history of a document or object are essential to understanding its meaning and context
- This principle guides archival practices and emphasizes the importance of preserving the original order and context of records

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Practices Before the Emergence of Provenance
- Prior to the development of modern archival standards, historical records were often arranged and described in a way that prioritized convenience over preservation and accessibility
- This approach often resulted in the fragmentation and dispersal of collections, making it difficult to understand their original context and meaning


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Emergence of Provenance_
- The emergence of provenance as a guiding principle in archival science can be traced back to the development of modern archival practices in the 19th century
- The introduction of standards and professional organizations helped to establish a more systematic approach to preserving and providing access to historical records


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Debates

- Despite the importance of provenance, there are ongoing debates within the archival community about its role in shaping our understanding of history
- Some argue that provenance can be too narrow a focus, neglecting the broader social and cultural contexts in which records were created

- Preservation is a critical aspect of archival science, as it ensures the long-term accessibility and authenticity of historical records
- Preservation strategies may include physical storage, digital duplication, and other techniques to protect against damage, loss, or degradation

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _The Beginnings of Preservation_

- The beginnings of preservation in archival science can be traced back to the development of paper and ink in ancient civilizations
- As written records became more widespread, so too did the need for their preservation

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Archival Preservation
- Archival preservation encompasses a range of techniques and technologies designed to protect historical records from damage or loss
- These may include proper storage conditions, handling practices, and digital duplication strategies


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Digital Preservation**
- With the increasing reliance on digital records, digital preservation has become an essential aspect of archival science
- Digital preservation involves the use of technologies such as data migration, file format conversion, and error correction to ensure long-term accessibility of digital content


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Information Access**

- A key goal of archival science is to provide access to historical records while also ensuring their long-term preservation
- Information access may involve the use of finding aids, catalogs, and other tools to help researchers locate and understand historical records

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Professional Associations

- Professional associations such as the Society of American Archivists (SAA) play an important role in promoting best practices and standards within the archival community
- These organizations provide a forum for archivists to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and advocate for the importance of archival science

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Regional Professional Associations

- In addition to national professional associations, there are also regional associations that serve specific geographic areas or communities
- These organizations may focus on issues particular to their region, such as the preservation of indigenous records or the management of local government archives.
