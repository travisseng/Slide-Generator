 # _Astronomy_

- Studied astronomy at Cambridge University
- Worked at the Cambridge Observatory
- Made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe, including the discovery of dark matter and the expansion of the universe

 # Dispute with Chandrasekhar on Existence of Black Holes
- Eddington disagreed with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's theory that white dwarfs could become so dense that they would collapse into black holes
- Eddington believed that the collapse would be halted by the electron degeneracy pressure of the star

 # _Relativity_
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Contributed to our understanding of relativity through his work on the curvature of spacetime and the behavior of massive objects under extreme conditions
- Developed the theory of "gravitational lensing" which predicts that the light from distant objects can be bent by the gravitational field of a massive object

 # Cosmology

- Made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe on large scales, including the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the determination of the age of the universe
- Developed the "steady-state" theory of the universe, which posits that the universe has always existed in its current state and has been expanding from an initial singularity

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Fundamental Theory and the Eddington Number**
- Proposed a fundamental theory of physics based on the principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics
- Introduced the concept of the "Eddington number," which is a measure of the strength of the gravitational field of an object and is used to determine the stability of white dwarfs


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Eddington Number for Cycling

- Also proposed an "Eddington number" for cycling, which is a measure of the efficiency of a bicycle and its rider in converting energy into motion

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Philosophy

- Held philosophical views that were influenced by his Quaker upbringing and his belief in the importance of social justice
- Believed in the idea of "idealism," which posits that the universe is fundamentally made up of ideas or consciousness, rather than matter and energy
- Also believed in the concept of "indeterminism," which suggests that the future is not predetermined, but rather it is shaped by the choices and actions of individuals

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Popular and Philosophical Writings**
- Wrote several popular science books, including "The Nature of the Physical World" and "The Large Scale Structure of the Universe"
- Also wrote philosophical works, such as "The Philosophy of Physical Science"
