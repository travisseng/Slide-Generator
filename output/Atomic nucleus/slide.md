 # Introduction

- Brief overview of the importance of atomic nuclei in understanding the structure of matter
- Purpose of the presentation: to explore the composition, shape, and forces within atomic nuclei, as well as the different models used to describe them

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # History

- Early observations of atomic nuclei: radioactive decay, nuclear reactions, and the discovery of isotopes
- Development of the nuclear model: from the early "plum pudding" model to the modern liquid drop and shell models

---

 # Etymology

- Explanation of the word "nucleus" and its origin
- Brief overview of the main components of an atomic nucleus: protons, neutrons, and electrons

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Nuclear makeup
- Composition of an atomic nucleus: protons and neutrons as the building blocks
- Number of protons and neutrons in a given nucleus, and how they determine the isotope of the element

 # Composition and shape
- Shape of atomic nuclei: spherical, oblate, or prolate
- Deformation of nuclei due to the strong nuclear force


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Forces

- Explanation of the strong nuclear force: the force that holds nucleons together in a nucleus
- Comparison of the strong nuclear force to other fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak, and gravity)

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Halo nuclei and nuclear force range limits
- Explanation of halo nuclei: nuclei with a high proportion of neutrons compared to protons
- Nuclear force range limits: the distance over which the strong nuclear force acts


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Nuclear models
- Overview of the different models used to describe atomic nuclei: liquid drop, shell, and other quantum models
- Advantages and limitations of each model


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Liquid drop model

- Explanation of the liquid drop model: a simplified description of the nucleus as a droplet of liquid
- Comparison to the more accurate shell models

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Shell models and other quantum models_
- Overview of shell models: a more detailed description of the nucleus based on the arrangement of nucleons in energy shells
- Other quantum models, such as the Woods-Saxon model and the Hartree-Fock model


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Consistency between models**

- Comparison of the different nuclear models and their predictions for various properties of atomic nuclei
- Discussion of the consistency and compatibility of the models with experimental data
