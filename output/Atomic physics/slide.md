 # Introduction to Atomic Physics
- Atomic physics is the study of the properties and behavior of atoms, which are the building blocks of matter.
- Atoms consist of a nucleus and electrons, and their interactions determine the properties of matter.

 # Isolated Atoms
- Isolated atoms are atoms that are not part of a molecule or a solid.
- The properties of isolated atoms are determined by their electronic configuration and nuclear stability.

- Electronic configuration refers to the arrangement of electrons in an atom.
- Electrons occupy specific energy levels, or shells, around the nucleus.
- Each shell can hold a certain number of electrons, and the electrons in each shell have a specific energy.

 # History and Developments

- Atomic physics has a long history, dating back to ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus, who proposed that matter was composed of indivisible particles called atoms.
- The modern study of atomic physics began in the late 19th century with the work of J.J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford.
- Significant developments in the field include the discovery of subatomic particles, such as electrons and neutrons, and the development of quantum mechanics.

 # Significant Atomic Physicists
- J.J. Thomson (1856-1940) discovered the electron and proposed the "plum pudding" model of the atom.
- Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) discovered the nucleus and proposed the "planetary" model of the atom.
- Niels Bohr (1885-1962) developed the Bohr model of the atom, which explained the energy levels of electrons.
- Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1967) developed quantum mechanics, which is a fundamental theory in atomic physics.
