- The study of atomic, molecular, and optical physics has a rich history dating back to ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus.
- The modern era of these fields began in the late 19th century with the work of scientists such as Max Planck, Niels Bohr, and Louis de Broglie.

 # _Classical Oscillator Model of Matter_

- The classical oscillator model of matter assumes that atoms and molecules can be described as simple harmonic oscillators.
- This model is a simplification of the more complex quantum mechanical behavior of particles, but it is useful for understanding many phenomena in atomic and molecular physics.

 # Early Quantum Model of Matter and Light

- The early quantum model of matter and light was developed in the early 20th century by scientists such as Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr.
- This model introduces the concept of wave-particle duality, where particles such as electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed.
