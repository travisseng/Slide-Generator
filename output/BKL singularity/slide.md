 # _BKL singularity_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Introduction
- The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe began as an infinitely hot and dense point around 13.8 billion years ago.
- However, this theory does not explain what happened before the Big Bang, or what caused the universe to begin expanding at such an incredible rate.
- One possible explanation is the BKL singularity, a theoretical point in space-time where the curvature becomes infinite.

 # Existence of Physical Time Singularity
- The concept of time is fundamental to our understanding of the universe, but what happens when time itself becomes distorted?
- Physicists believe that a physical time singularity may exist at the center of a black hole, where the curvature of space-time becomes so extreme that it creates a point where time ceases to exist.
- This idea is supported by mathematical models and observations of black holes.

 # Generalized Homogeneous Solution

- In order to understand the BKL singularity, we need to look at the behavior of the universe on extremely small scales.
- One way to do this is through a generalized homogeneous solution, which allows us to study the behavior of the universe in a simplified way.
- This solution shows that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion in the very early stages of its history.

 # The BKL Conjecture
- The BKL conjecture states that the universe began as an infinitely hot and dense point, and has been expanding ever since.
- This conjecture is supported by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which suggest that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion in the very early stages of its history.

- Another way to understand the BKL singularity is through the Kasner solution, which describes the behavior of the universe on extremely small scales.
- This solution shows that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion in the very early stages of its history, and that this expansion was driven by a certain type of energy.

 # Oscillating Mode towards the Singularity

- As we approach the BKL singularity, the universe begins to exhibit an oscillating mode of behavior.
- This means that the universe is constantly expanding and contracting, with each cycle becoming shorter and more intense.
- This oscillating mode is thought to be driven by the energy that was present in the very early stages of the universe.

 # _Metric Evolution_

- The metric evolution of the universe can be described using a series of mathematical equations.
- These equations show that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion in the very early stages of its history, and that this expansion was driven by a certain type of energy.
- The equations also suggest that the universe is still expanding today, although at a much slower rate than it did in the very early stages of its history.

 # _Two Perturbations_

- In order to better understand the behavior of the universe near the BKL singularity, we can use two perturbations to study the effects of different types of energy on the universe.
- The first perturbation is a scalar field, which describes the energy that was present in the very early stages of the universe.
- The second perturbation is a vector field, which describes the behavior of the universe on extremely small scales.

 # Small-Time Domain
- In order to study the behavior of the universe near the BKL singularity, we need to look at the small-time domain.
- This means studying the behavior of the universe over very short periods of time, in order to understand the effects of the energy present in the very early stages of the universe.

- In order to better understand the behavior of the universe near the BKL singularity, we can use statistical analysis to study the patterns and trends in the data.

 # General Solution with Small Oscillations
- One way to understand the behavior of the universe near the BKL singularity is through a general solution with small oscillations.
- This solution describes the behavior of the universe over very short periods of time, and shows that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion in the very early stages of its history.
