 # Backscatter (photography)

 # **Introduction**
- Backscatter photography is a technique used in underwater photography to capture images of the subject with a soft, diffused light.
- The term "backscatter" refers to the scattered light that is reflected back towards the camera lens.

 # Cause of Backscatter
- Backscatter is caused by the interaction between light and particles in the water.
- When light enters the water, it hits tiny particles such as dust, salt, and other impurities, causing them to scatter in all directions.
- This scattered light is then reflected back towards the camera lens, creating a soft, diffused effect.

- Some photographers claim that backscatter can be used to capture images of paranormal entities such as ghosts or UFOs.
- These claims are often based on the idea that the scattered light can create strange, otherworldly effects in the image.
- However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, and most experts consider them to be pseudoscience.
