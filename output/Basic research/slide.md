 # _Overview_

- Definition of basic research: "Basic research is research that is undertaken for the sake of understanding a phenomenon or discovering new knowledge, rather than to solve a specific practical problem." (Source: National Science Foundation)
- Importance of basic research: "Basic research has led to many technological and medical advances that have improved our quality of life. It has also helped us better understand the world around us and has contributed to the development of new ideas and discoveries." (Source: American Association for the Advancement of Science)

 # Basic versus Applied Science
- Definition of applied science: "Applied science is the use of scientific knowledge and principles to develop practical solutions to real-world problems." (Source: Sciencing)
- Comparison of basic and applied research: "Basic research seeks to understand the underlying principles of a phenomenon, while applied research seeks to solve a specific problem or create a new technology. Both are important for advancing knowledge and improving our world." (Source: American Association for the Advancement of Science)
