 # **Work**
- Research areas include human-computer interaction, information visualization, and universal usability
- Developed the Nassi-Shneiderman diagram, a widely used graphical representation of computer interfaces
- Coined the term "direct manipulation" to describe interactions that allow users to directly manipulate objects on the screen
- Developed the concept of "information visualization" to describe the use of visual representations to support analytical thinking

 # Nassi-Shneiderman Diagram
- A graphical representation of computer interfaces that shows the relationships between different elements of a system
- Used to design and evaluate user interfaces


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Flowchart Research
- Developed a series of flowcharts to represent different types of human-computer interaction
- Used these flowcharts to study and improve the design of computer interfaces

 # Taxonomy of Interactive Dynamics for Visual Analysis
- A system for classifying interactive visualization techniques based on their underlying principles and goals
- Provides a framework for understanding and evaluating different types of interactive visualization systems


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Universal Usability

- The idea that user interfaces should be designed to be usable by all people, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds
- Involves understanding the needs and limitations of diverse users and designing interfaces that are accessible and easy to use for everyone

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Human-Centered AI

- The idea that artificial intelligence systems should be designed with the needs and well-being of humans in mind
- Involves developing AI systems that are transparent, explainable, and controllable by users
