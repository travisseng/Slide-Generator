 # Bibcode (identifier)

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Adoption
- Bibcode is widely adopted by researchers and institutions in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary science.
- It is used to uniquely identify scientific papers, conference proceedings, and other documents related to these fields.
- Many databases and online repositories use Bibcode as a standard identifier for their content.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.76em}</style>

 # Format

- A Bibcode consists of a series of letters and numbers that are separated by spaces or hyphens.
- The format of a Bibcode is as follows:

+ The first letter indicates the type of document (e.g. "A" for an article, "B" for a book, etc.)

+ The next two letters indicate the publication name (e.g. "Astron" for the journal "Astronomy")

+ The following numbers represent the year of publication and the page numbers where the document can be found.
- For example, the Bibcode "A12345678" would represent a paper titled "Title of Paper" published in the journal "Astron" in the year 2022 on pages 1-8.

 # Examples
- Here are some examples of Bibcodes for different types of documents:

+ Article: A12345678 (as previously mentioned)

+ Book: B98765432 (the numbers represent the year of publication and page count)

+ Conference proceedings: P12345678 (the "P" indicates a proceedings volume)

+ Technical report: T12345678 (the "T" indicates a technical report)
- These are just a few examples, but there are many more possible combinations of letters and numbers that can be used in a Bibcode.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like me to add anything else to the presentation.
