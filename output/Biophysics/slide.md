- Biophysics is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles from physics and biology to study the physical and biological processes of living systems.
- It seeks to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the behavior of living things, from the molecular level to entire organisms and ecosystems.

 # History
- Biophysics as a field began to take shape in the early 20th century, with the work of scientists such as Max Delbr√ºck, who applied quantum mechanics to the study of biological systems.
- The field has since grown to include a wide range of subfields, including biomechanics, bioelectromagnetism, and computational biophysics.

 # **Focus as a Subfield**
- Biophysics is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of topics, from the structure and function of biomolecules to the mechanisms of cellular transport and signaling.
- Some specific areas of focus within biophysics include:

+ Biomechanics: the study of the mechanical properties of living systems, such as the elasticity of cells and tissues.

+ Bioelectromagnetism: the study of the electromagnetic fields and currents that are generated by living systems.

+ Computational biophysics: the use of computational models and simulations to understand the behavior of biological systems.
