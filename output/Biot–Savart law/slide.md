 # **Equation**
- The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point in space is proportional to the electric current density J passing through a conductor
- Mathematically, the equation is given by:

dB = (μ0/4π) \* J

where μ0 is the permeability of free space and J is the electric current density

 # _Electric Currents (along a closed curve/wire)_
- The Biot-Savart Law applies to any closed curve or wire that carries an electric current
- The magnetic field strength is proportional to the amount of current flowing through the conductor

 # Electric Current Density (throughout conductor volume)
- The Biot-Savart Law also applies to the electric current density throughout the volume of a conductor
- The magnetic field strength is proportional to the total electric current passing through the conductor

 # Constant Uniform Current

- If the current flowing through a conductor is constant and uniform, the magnetic field strength will be constant and directed along the axis of the conductor
