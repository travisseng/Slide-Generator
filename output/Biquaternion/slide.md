 # **Definition**

Biquaternions are a number system that extends the complex numbers to four dimensions. They were introduced by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843.

 # **Linear Representation**


Biquaternions can be represented as 2x2 matrices, which allows for easy manipulation of biquaternion algebra. This representation is particularly useful in computer graphics and robotics.

 # Subalgebras

Biquaternions have several subalgebras, including the set of pure quaternions (i.e., biquaternions with zero scalar part). These subalgebras are important in various applications, such as computer graphics and robotics.

 # Algebraic Properties

Biquaternions have several important algebraic properties, including the following:
- They form a commutative ring under addition and multiplication.
- They are associative under multiplication.
- They have an identity element (the zero biquaternion).
- They have inverse elements (for any non-zero biquaternion, there exists another biquaternion that multiplies to give the identity).

 # Associated Terminology


There are several important terms associated with biquaternions, including:
- Pure quaternion: A biquaternion with zero scalar part.
- Biquaternion product: The multiplication of two biquaternions.
- Biquaternion inverse: The inverse of a non-zero biquaternion.
- Biquaternion norm: The magnitude of a biquaternion.

 # As a Composition Algebra

Biquaternions can be viewed as a composition algebra, which is a mathematical structure that consists of a vector space equipped with an associative product operation. This perspective provides a powerful way to study and manipulate biquaternions.
