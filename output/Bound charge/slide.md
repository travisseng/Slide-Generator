 # Bound charge

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Definition
- Bound charge is a type of electric charge that is confined within a dielectric material
- It arises from the interaction between the electric field and the polarization of the material


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _Other Expressions_
- Bound charge can also be expressed as the surface charge density at the interface between two media with different dielectric constants
- It is related to the electric displacement field D and the electric field E through the equation:

P = (1/2) (D - E)

- Gauss's law for the field of P states that the sum of the bound charges within a closed surface is proportional to the net flux of the electric field through the surface

 # Differential Form

- The bound charge density can be written in differential form as:

dP = (1/2) (dD - dE)

 # _Relationship between the Fields of P and E_

- The relationship between the fields of P and E is given by:

E = D - P

- In homogeneous, isotropic dielectrics, the bound charge density is proportional to the electric field

 # **Anisotropic Dielectrics**
- In anisotropic dielectrics, the bound charge density can be different in different directions

 # Polarization Density in Maxwell's Equations
- The polarization density is included in Maxwell's equations to describe the interaction between the electric field and the material


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Relations between E, D and P

- The relations between E, D and P can be expressed as:

E = D - P

P = (1/2) (D - E)

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # **Time-Varying Polarization Density**

- In time-varying situations, the polarization density can be complex and depend on both the electric field and the material properties

 # Polarization Ambiguity[dubious â€“ discuss]
- The polarization ambiguity refers to the fact that there are multiple possible polarization states for a given material and electric field configuration

 # Crystalline Materials
- In crystalline materials, the bound charge density can be influenced by the crystal structure and lattice vibrations


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Amorphous Materials
- In amorphous materials, the bound charge density is more difficult to predict due to the lack of a crystal structure
