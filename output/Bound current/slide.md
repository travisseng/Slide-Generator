 # _Bound current_

 # Definition

- Bound current is the flow of electrons in a conductor that is subject to an external magnetic field
- It is also known as the magnetically-induced current or the magnetic current

 # _In Maxwell's Equations_
- Bound current is described by Maxwell's equations, which are a set of four partial differential equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields
- The equations include the Gauss law for electric fields, the Gauss law for magnetic fields, Faraday's law of induction, and Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction

 # _Relations between B, H, and M_

- B (bound current density) is related to H (magnetic field strength) and M (magnetization vector) by the equation:

B = (μ₀/4π) \* (H × M)
- This equation shows that bound current is proportional to the magnetic field strength and the product of the magnetization vector and the magnetic field direction

 # Magnetic Polarization
- Magnetic polarization is the alignment of electronic spins in a conductor due to an external magnetic field
- The aligned electronic spins create a magnetic moment that interacts with the magnetic field

 # Reversal
- Magnetic reversal is the process by which a magnetization vector rotates through 180 degrees
- Magnetic reversal can occur due to changes in the magnetic field, temperature, or other factors

 # Demagnetization
- Demagnetization is the process by which a magnet loses its magnetization due to external influences such as heat, vibration, or an external magnetic field
- Demagnetization can occur through various mechanisms, including magnetic field decay, thermal fluctuations, and domain wall motion
