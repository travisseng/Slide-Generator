 # Introduction to Bremsstrahlung

- Bremsstrahlung is the emission of electromagnetic radiation by an accelerated charged particle
- Also known as braking radiation or deceleration radiation

 # **Classical Description**
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Charged particles (e.g. electrons) accelerate through a medium (e.g. air, vacuum) and emit electromagnetic radiation
- Radiation is emitted in all directions from the particle's trajectory
</div>

 # _Total Radiated Power_
- The total radiated power of bremsstrahlung is proportional to the square of the particle's velocity
- The radiation is emitted over a wide range of frequencies, with a peak frequency at the electron's cyclotron frequency


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Angular Distribution_
- The angular distribution of bremsstrahlung radiation is determined by the particle's trajectory and the properties of the medium it is accelerating through
- The radiation is emitted in a conical shape around the particle's trajectory


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Simplified Quantum-Mechanical Description
- Bremsstrahlung can be described using quantum mechanics as a transition from a higher energy state to a lower energy state
- The radiation is emitted when an electron transitions from a bound state to a continuum state

- Thermal bremsstrahlung is the emission and absorption of bremsstrahlung radiation by electrons in a thermal plasma
- The radiation is emitted and absorbed at all directions, resulting in a random walk of the electrons' momentum

 # **Bremsstrahlung Cooling**
- Bremsstrahlung can be used for cooling of plasma particles, particularly in fusion research
- The radiation is emitted at a frequency that is absorbed by the plasma particles, causing them to lose energy and cool down

 # **Polarizational Bremsstrahlung**
- Polarizational bremsstrahlung is the emission of bremsstrahlung radiation from a charged particle oscillating in a magnetic field
- This type of bremsstrahlung is important in the study of plasma instabilities and wave-particle interactions

 # Sources
- X-ray tubes use bremsstrahlung radiation to produce X-rays for medical imaging and other applications
- Beta decay can also produce bremsstrahlung radiation, as well as other types of radiation

 # Inner and Outer Bremsstrahlung
- Inner bremsstrahlung is the emission of radiation from an accelerated charged particle within a medium
- Outer bremsstrahlung is the emission of radiation from an accelerated charged particle at the surface of a medium
