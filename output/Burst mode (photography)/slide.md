 # Details
- Burst mode is a camera feature that allows you to capture multiple photos in quick succession
- Also known as continuous shooting or high-speed shooting
- Useful for capturing fast-moving subjects, such as sports and wildlife photography

 # Burst Rate
- The rate at which the camera can capture photos in burst mode
- Measured in frames per second (fps) or shots per second
- Higher burst rates allow for more photos to be captured in a shorter amount of time

 # **Use**

- Burst mode is useful for capturing moments that are difficult to capture with a single shot, such as:

+ Fast-moving subjects (e.g. sports, wildlife)

+ Unpredictable moments (e.g. children playing, pets reacting)

+ High-speed action (e.g. motorsports, dance performances)

 # Advantages

- Allows for more creative flexibility in post-processing
- Increases the chances of capturing the perfect shot
- Can help to capture moments that might be missed with a single shot

 # Tips and Tricks
- Use burst mode in conjunction with a tripod or other stabilizing device for sharp images
- Anticipate the action and be ready to start capturing photos as soon as it begins
- Experiment with different burst rates and shutter speeds to find the best combination for your needs

 # _Camera Settings_

- Check your camera's manual to determine the specific settings for burst mode
- Common settings include:

+ Burst rate (fps)

 # _Examples_

- Example 1: Capturing a bird in flight with burst mode
- Example 2: Using burst mode to capture multiple shots of a child playing on a swing set
- Example 3: Burst mode can be used for creative effects, such as capturing multiple exposures of a single scene for a composite image.
