- CERN was founded in 1954 by a group of European physicists who wanted to create a research organization dedicated to particle physics.
- The first particle accelerator at CERN was the Synchrocyclotron, which was built in 1957.
- Since then, CERN has developed and operated a series of increasingly powerful particle accelerators, culminating in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) today.
