 # Introduction to Capacitance
- Capacitance is the ability of a device to store electric charge
- Measured in Farads (F), with 1 F = 1 coulomb/volt

 # Self Capacitance
- Self capacitance is the capacitance of an object to itself
- Caused by the electric field generated by the object's charges
- Example: a charged particle in an isolated system will have self capacitance

 # Mutual Capacitance

- Mutual capacitance is the capacitance between two objects
- Caused by the electric field generated by one object interacting with the other object's charges
- Example: two charged particles in close proximity will have mutual capacitance

 # Capacitance Matrix
- A capacitance matrix is a table of capacitances between all possible pairs of objects
- Used to describe the behavior of complex systems with multiple capacitors and objects

 # **Capacitors**
- Capacitors are devices that store electric charge
- Have a positive and negative terminal, and a dielectric material inside
- Capacitance is determined by the size of the plates, the distance between them, and the dielectric material

 # Stray Capacitance

- Stray capacitance is the capacitance between two objects due to unintentional contact or exposure to an electric field
- Can be a significant source of error in high-precision circuits

 # Capacitance of Conductors with Simple Shapes

- The capacitance of a conductor is proportional to the surface area and inversely proportional to the distance between the conductor and the object it is capacitively coupled to
- Can be calculated using equations such as C = ε0A/d, where C is the capacitance, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, A is the surface area, and d is the distance
