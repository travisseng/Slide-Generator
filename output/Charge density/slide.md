 # Definitions
- Charge density: a measure of the distribution of electric charge within a given volume.
- Electric charge: a fundamental property of matter that gives rise to the electromagnetic force.

- Charge density can be thought of as a continuous distribution of charge, rather than discrete particles.
- This allows for a more precise description of the charge distribution in certain systems.

 # Free, Bound and Total Charge
- Free charge: the amount of electric charge that is not bound to any particular particle or system.
- Bound charge: the amount of electric charge that is bound to a particular particle or system.
- Total charge: the sum of free and bound charges.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Total Charge Densities

- The total charge density is the density of the total amount of electric charge in a given volume.
- This can be calculated using the above definitions of free, bound and total charge.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Bound Charge

- Bound charge is the amount of electric charge that is bound to a particular particle or system.
- This can be due to the Coulomb attraction between charged particles.

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Free Charge Density

- The free charge density is the density of the free electric charge in a given volume.
- This can be calculated by subtracting the bound charge from the total charge.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Homogeneous Charge Density**
- In a homogeneous charge density, the charge density is the same throughout the entire system.
- This can be useful for simplifying certain calculations in electromagnetic theory.


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Proof
- The proof of the above statements and equations can be found in various texts on electromagnetic theory.


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Discrete Charges

- In some cases, it is more useful to consider discrete charges rather than continuous charge density.
- This can be done by introducing a finite number of charged particles into the system.

 # Charge Density in Special Relativity

- In special relativity, the concept of charge density takes on a different form.
- The Lorentz transformation affects the space-time distribution of electric charge.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Charge Density in Quantum Mechanics
- In quantum mechanics, the concept of charge density is related to the wave function of the system.
- The charge density can be calculated using the Schr√∂dinger equation and the wave function of the system.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Applications
- Charge density is an important concept in various areas of physics, including electromagnetic theory, quantum mechanics and special relativity.
- It has applications in fields such as plasma physics, condensed matter physics and particle physics.
