 # Flow Maps

- Minard's most famous work is his flow map of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812
- The map shows the movement of Napoleon's army over time, with the width of the lines representing the number of soldiers
- This visualization allowed for a quick understanding of the campaign's progress and the challenges faced by the French army

 # The Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign
- Minard's flow map of Napoleon's Russian campaign is considered one of the greatest information graphics of all time
- The map shows the movement of over 400,000 soldiers and the loss of over 100,000 men during the disastrous campaign
- The map has been widely reproduced and studied for its insights into military strategy and data visualization
