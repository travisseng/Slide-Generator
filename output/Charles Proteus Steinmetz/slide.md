 # _Socialism and Technocracy_
- As a young man, Steinmetz became involved in socialist and technocratic movements
- Believed in the power of technology to create a more equal society
- Advocated for the use of science and engineering to improve the lives of working-class people

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # _Electrical Engineering_
- Steinmetz's work in electrical engineering focused on the practical applications of AC (alternating current) electricity
- Developed theories on AC hysteresis, AC steady state circuit theory, and AC transient theory
- Patented numerous inventions related to AC electricity, including the first practical alternating-current system for distribution of electrical energy

 # AC Hysteresis Theory
- Steinmetz's work on AC hysteresis theory explained how the magnetic field of an AC circuit behaves over time
- Helped to improve the efficiency of AC systems and laid the foundation for modern power distribution systems


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **AC Steady State Circuit Theory**

- Steinmetz developed a set of equations that described the behavior of AC circuits in steady-state conditions
- This work helped to simplify the design of AC systems and expand their use in industry and households

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # AC Transient Theory

- Steinmetz also studied the behavior of AC circuits during transients, or brief changes in current or voltage
- Developed a set of equations that described the transient behavior of AC circuits

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Professional Life
- Steinmetz worked for the General Electric Company (GE) from 1893 until his death in 1923
- Became known as the "father of alternating current" and was a leading figure in the development of modern electrical power systems
- Collaborated with other engineers and scientists, including Nikola Tesla, to advance the field of electrical engineering
