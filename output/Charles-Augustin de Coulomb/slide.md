- Known for his work on friction and the properties of materials
- Developed the concept of "Coulomb's Law" which describes the relationship between the force of friction and the normal force acting on an object
- Measured the coefficient of friction for various surfaces, including metal, wood, and ice
- Also studied the behavior of electric currents and developed a theory of electricity that was later refined by other scientists

 # Key Contributions
- Coulomb's Law: The force of friction is proportional to the normal force acting on an object, and is independent of the distance over which the forces are applied.
- Coefficient of Friction: A measure of the amount of friction that occurs between two surfaces, calculated as the ratio of the force of friction to the normal force.
- Electricity: Developed a theory of electricity that explained the behavior of electric currents and the properties of electrical charges.

 # **Impact and Legacy**
- Coulomb's work on friction and electricity laid the foundation for many modern technologies, including brakes, lubrication, and electrical power distribution systems.
- His contributions to engineering and physics have had a lasting impact on science and technology, and his name is still widely recognized today.
- Coulomb's Law remains an important tool for engineers, physicists, and materials scientists, and is used in a wide range of applications from designing machine components to understanding the behavior of geological materials.
