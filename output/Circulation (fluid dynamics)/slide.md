 # Introduction
- Definition: Circulation is the flow of fluid around a closed path, such as in a river or ocean current.
- Properties: Circulation can be described by its velocity and pressure fields, and it plays a crucial role in many natural and industrial processes.

 # Relation to Vorticity and Curl
- Vorticity: The rotation of fluid around a vertical axis.
- Curl: A measure of the rotation of a vector field around a closed path.
- Relation: Circulation is closely related to vorticity and curl, as it can be described by these properties.

 # Kutta-Joukowski Theorem in Fluid Dynamics

- Statement: The Kutta-Joukowski theorem states that the drag force on an object in a fluid is proportional to the velocity of the fluid relative to the object.
- Significance: This theorem is crucial in understanding the behavior of objects in fluids, such as airplanes and boats.
