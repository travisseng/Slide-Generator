 # Classical physics

 # Overview
- Classical physics refers to the scientific knowledge and methods developed in the ancient Greek period and improved upon by scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, and Newton.
- It is based on empirical observations and simplifying assumptions that do not account for quantum or relativistic effects.

 # Comparison with Modern Physics
- Classical physics is a limiting case of modern physics, which includes quantum mechanics and general relativity.
- Modern physics introduces principles such as wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and the equivalence of all reference frames.
- Classical physics is sufficient for many everyday applications but fails to describe phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level.

 # Computer Modeling and Manual Calculation
- Classical physics can be modeled using computers, allowing for precise calculations and simulations of complex systems.
- However, manual calculation is also possible and often preferred when simplicity and physical insight are more important than precision.
- Both computer modeling and manual calculation have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and context.

 # Modern and Classic Comparison
- Modern physics introduces new principles that contradict classical assumptions, such as the idea that space and time are relative rather than absolute.
- Classical physics assumes a deterministic, predictable universe, while modern physics reveals an inherently probabilistic nature.
- Despite these differences, classical physics remains a useful tool for understanding many natural phenomena and is often used in conjunction with modern physics to solve real-world problems.

 # **Conclusion**
- Classical physics provides a foundation for understanding the natural world that is still relevant today, despite the limitations of its assumptions.
- By recognizing the differences between classical and modern physics, we can better appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and use them effectively in different contexts.
- The study of classical physics remains essential for developing a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it.
