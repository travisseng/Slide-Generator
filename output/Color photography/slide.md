 # History
- Subtitle: The first color photograph was taken in 1861 by James Clerk Maxwell
- Content: Maxwell's experiment used additive color, where each color is captured on a separate glass plate and then combined to create the final image. This method was later improved upon by other photographers, leading to the development of color photography as we know it today.

 # Three-Color Processes

- Subtitle: A technique for capturing color images using red, green, and blue filters
- Content: This process was developed in the early 20th century and involves taking three separate photographs of an image through red, green, and blue filters. The filters are then combined to create a full-color image.

 # Screen-Plate Era
- Subtitle: A method for mass-producing color photographs
- Content: In the mid-20th century, the screen-plate process was developed, which allowed for the mass production of color photographs. This process involves creating a screen negative from an original positive image, and then using that screen to print multiple copies of the image.
