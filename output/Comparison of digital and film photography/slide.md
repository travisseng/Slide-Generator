<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Introduction
- Brief overview of the comparison between digital and film photography


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Image Quality
- Digital photography: Higher image quality due to more accurate color representation and better dynamic range
- Film photography: Warm, grainy look that is often preferred by photographers


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Spatial Resolution

- Digital photography: Higher spatial resolution due to the use of megapixels
- Film photography: Limited by the size of the film format

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Noise and Grain
- Digital photography: Less noise and grain, especially at higher ISOs
- Film photography: More visible noise and grain, especially at higher ISOs


---

 # White Balance
- Digital photography: Easier to adjust white balance in post-processing
- Film photography: More challenging to adjust white balance, requires more knowledge of color temperatures


---

 # Dynamic Range

- Digital photography: Wider dynamic range due to the use of more advanced techniques such as HDR
- Film photography: Limited by the physical properties of film

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Convenience and Flexibility
- Digital photography: More convenient and flexible, allowing for instant review and deletion of photos, as well as more easily sharing and editing images
- Film photography: Less convenient and less flexible, requiring more time and effort to develop and edit photos


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Film Speed**
- Film photography: Faster film speeds allow for capturing faster movements and more candid moments
- Digital photography: Slower shutter speeds can be challenging when capturing fast-moving subjects


---

 # Cleanliness

- Film photography: More prone to dust, scratches, and other forms of physical damage
- Digital photography: Less prone to physical damage, but more susceptible to digital noise and errors

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Cost
- Film photography: More expensive due to the cost of film, development, and scanning
- Digital photography: Less expensive due to the lack of physical costs, such as film and development


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Film Industry
- Film industry still exists and thrives, with many photographers preferring the aesthetic and tactile qualities of film
- Digital photography has become the dominant form of photography, offering greater convenience and flexibility.

I hope this presentation provides a helpful comparison between digital and film photography!
