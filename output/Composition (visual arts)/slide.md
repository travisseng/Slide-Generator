 # **Composition (visual arts)**

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction to Composition
- Definition of composition: the arrangement of elements in a work of art to create a visually appealing and effective whole
- Importance of composition in visual arts: it can make or break a piece of art


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.80em}</style>

 # Elements of Design

- Line: a continuous mark made on a surface by a moving point
- Shape: a self-contained area defined by a line or lines
- Form: a three-dimensional volume created by light and shadow
- Texture: the surface quality or feel of an object
- Value: the lightness or darkness of a color

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Color

- Properties of color: hue, saturation, value
- Color theory: color wheel, primary colors, secondary colors, warm and cool colors
- Color harmony: complementary colors, analogous colors, split-complementary colors

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **Texture**
- Types of texture: rough, smooth, bumpy, etc.
- Creating texture with brushstrokes, layering, and other techniques
- Importance of texture in composition: adds depth, interest, and tactility


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Value

- Definition of value: the lightness or darkness of a color
- Using value to create depth, volume, and contrast in a composition
- Examples of value in art: chiaroscuro, grisaille, monochromatic color schemes

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Form
- Definition of form: a three-dimensional volume created by light and shadow
- Using form to create interest and depth in a composition
- Examples of form in art: still life compositions, figure drawings, sculptures


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Space

- Definition of space: the area around, between, and within objects in a composition
- Types of space: positive, negative, atmospheric, etc.
- Using space to create balance, harmony, and visual interest in a composition

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # _Principles of Organization_
- Balance: the distribution of weight or visual interest in a composition
- Proportion: the relationship of one part to another in terms of size and scale
- Emphasis: the focal point or points in a composition
- Unity: the sense of coherence and oneness in a composition


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Viewpoint (Leading with the Eye)
- Definition of viewpoint: the vantage point from which the viewer sees the composition
- Using viewpoint to guide the viewer's eye through a composition
- Examples of leading the viewer's eye: diagonal lines, curves, focal points


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Compositional Techniques
- Overlapping: placing objects or forms one in front of another
- Repetition: repeating shapes, lines, colors, or textures to create visual interest
- Negative space: the empty space around and between objects in a composition
- Cropping: cutting off parts of an object or scene to create a more composed image


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Rule of Thirds
- Definition of rule of thirds: dividing a composition into thirds both horizontally and vertically, and placing important elements along those lines or at their intersections
- Using the rule of thirds to create balance, harmony, and visual interest in a composition

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Rule of Odds

- Definition of rule of odds: placing objects or forms in groups of three or more to create visual interest and balance
- Using the rule of odds to create rhythm, movement, and depth in a composition

</div>
</div>

- Definition of rule of space: using negative space to create balance, harmony, and visual interest in a composition
- Examples of using negative space: placing objects or forms near the edges of the canvas, using the space between objects to create contrast and visual interest

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Simplification

- Definition of simplification: reducing the complexity of a composition by removing unnecessary elements or details
- Using simplification to create clarity, unity, and visual impact in a composition

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Shallow Depth of Field**

- Definition of shallow depth of field: focusing on a specific part of an image while blurring the rest
- Using shallow depth of field to create bokeh, selective focus, and visual interest in a composition

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Geometry and Symmetry
- Definition of geometry: the study of shapes, lines, and forms in art
- Definition of symmetry: the quality of being the same on both sides of a central axis
- Using geometry and symmetry to create balance, harmony, and visual interest in a composition
