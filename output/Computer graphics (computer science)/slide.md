 # Animation

- Keyframe animation: the process of creating motion by defining specific points in time and the corresponding positions of objects
- Motion capture: the use of sensors to record real-world movement and apply it to computer-generated characters or objects
- Physics-based animation: simulating realistic motion using mathematical equations

 # Rendering
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Ray tracing: a technique for generating photorealistic images by simulating the way light behaves in the real world
- Global illumination: the study of how light scatters and bounces off various surfaces, leading to more realistic renderings
- Important applications in areas such as film, video games, and architectural visualization
