 # Continuum mechanics

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Concept of a Continuum**
- Definition of a continuum: a continuous mass of matter without any voids or gaps
- Examples of continua: solids, liquids, gases, and other forms of matter


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Major Areas

- Mechanics of deformable solids: study of the behavior of solids under external forces and boundary conditions
- Fluid mechanics: study of the behavior of fluids under external forces and boundary conditions
- Thermodynamics: study of the relationships between heat, work, and energy

- Continuum assumption: matter is treated as a continuous medium rather than individual particles
- Mathematical models: used to describe the behavior of continua under various conditions
- Types of models: empirical, analytical, numerical

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **Forces in a Continuum**

- Types of forces: surface forces, body forces, external forces
- Surface forces: forces that act on the surface of a material, such as tension and compression
- Body forces: forces that act within a material, such as gravity and magnetism

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Surface Forces

- Tension: force that acts along a surface, such as a stretched rubber band
- Compression: force that acts along a surface, such as a compressed spring

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Body Forces

- Gravity: force that acts on an object due to its mass and the Earth's gravitational field
- Magnetism: force that acts on an object due to its magnetic properties and the magnetic field of another object

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Kinematics: Motion and Deformation
- Motion: change in position over time
- Deformation: change in shape or size under external forces
- Types of deformation: elastic, plastic, viscoelastic

 # **Lagrangian Description**
- Lagrangian mechanics: description of the motion of a continuum based on the Lagrange function
- Advantages and limitations: Lagrangian description provides a more intuitive understanding of the motion of a continuum, but it may not be suitable for all types of problems


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Eulerian Description**

- Eulerian mechanics: description of the motion of a continuum based on the Euler equations
- Advantages and limitations: Eulerian description provides a more general framework for analyzing the motion of a continuum, but it may be more difficult to interpret and apply

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Displacement Field**
- Definition: field that describes the displacement of each point in a continuum relative to its initial position
- Examples: displacement fields for simple harmonic motion, rectilinear motion, and other types of motion


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Governing Equations_

- Balance laws: equations that describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for a continuum
- Governing equations: equations that describe the behavior of a continuum under various conditions, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid mechanics and the wave equation for elastic solids

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Clausius-Duhem Inequality_
- Definition: inequality that relates the internal energy of a continuum to its entropy and temperature
- Importance: provides a fundamental limit on the efficiency of any heat engine or refrigerator


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Validity
- Assumptions: assumptions underlying the mathematical models of continuum mechanics, such as the continuum assumption and the linearization hypothesis
- Validity: extent to which the assumptions are valid and the models are reliable

 # Applications
- Engineering applications: design and analysis of structures, machines, and other devices that involve the use of continua
- Scientific applications: study of natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and ocean currents, that involve the behavior of continua
