 # **Applications**

- Crime analysis: using maps to visualize and analyze criminal activity, such as identifying patterns and trends in crime data
- Law enforcement: using crime maps to inform patrol routes, target high-crime areas, and support investigations
- Public safety: providing the public with access to crime data to help them make informed decisions about their safety and security
