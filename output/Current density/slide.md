 # _Introduction_
- Current density is a measure of the amount of electric current flowing through a given area.
- It is an important concept in understanding the behavior of electrical circuits and devices.

 # Definition

- Current density is defined as the ratio of the total current flowing through a cross-sectional area of a conductor to the area itself.
- It is typically measured in units of A/m^2 (amps per square meter).

 # Importance

- Knowing the current density in a conductor is important for understanding the heat dissipation, power loss, and material properties of the conductor.
- Current density is also important for designing and optimizing electrical circuits and devices.

 # Calculation of current densities in matter
- The total current density (J) can be calculated using the following formula:

J = Î£(I) / A

where I is the current flowing through each cross-sectional area of the conductor, and A is the area of the conductor.

 # Free currents

- Free currents are currents that flow through a conductor without encountering any resistance or impedance.
- These currents are important for understanding the behavior of superconductors and other low-resistance materials.

 # Polarization and magnetization currents

- Polarization currents are the currents that flow through a material due to external electric fields.
- Magnetization currents are the currents that flow through a material due to external magnetic fields.

 # Total current in materials
- The total current in a material is the sum of all the free and polarization/magnetization currents flowing through it.

 # Displacement current
- Displacement current is a type of current that flows through a material due to changes in the electric field, even when there is no net charge movement.
- It is an important concept in understanding the behavior of capacitors and other energy storage devices.

 # Continuity equation

- The continuity equation states that the total current entering a closed loop must be equal to the total current leaving the loop.
- This equation is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering and is widely used to analyze and design circuits.
