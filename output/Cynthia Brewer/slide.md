 # Brewer Palettes
- Characteristics: based on a set of base colors, each palette consists of 3-6 colors, and the colors are chosen to be mutually agreeable in terms of hue, saturation, and lightness
- Examples: Brewer palettes have been used in a variety of fields, including climate visualization, financial data analysis, and art installations
