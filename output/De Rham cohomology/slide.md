 # De Rham cohomology

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Definition_

- De Rham cohomology is a branch of algebraic topology that studies the cohomology of smooth manifolds using the language of differentiable forms.
- It was introduced by Jean Leray in the 1940s and developed by Simon Donaldson in the 1980s.

 # De Rham cohomology computed

- The de Rham cohomology of a manifold is defined as the cohomology of the space of smooth differentiable forms on the manifold, with the cup product as the multiplication operation.
- The de Rham cohomology groups are invariant under smooth diffeomorphisms, making them a useful tool for studying the properties of manifolds.

 # The n-sphere
- The n-sphere is a classic example of a manifold with non-trivial de Rham cohomology.
- The de Rham cohomology groups of the n-sphere are given by H^0(S^n) = Z, H^1(S^n) = 0, and H^2(S^n) = Z, where Z is the integers.

 # Punctured Euclidean space

- The punctured Euclidean space is a manifold that is obtained by removing a point from Euclidean space.
- The de Rham cohomology groups of the punctured Euclidean space are given by H^0(Euclidean space - {pt}) = Z, H^1(Euclidean space - {pt}) = 0, and H^2(Euclidean space - {pt}) = Z.

 # The Möbius strip
- The Möbius strip is a example of a manifold with non-trivial de Rham cohomology.
- The de Rham cohomology groups of the Möbius strip are given by H^0(Mobius strip) = Z, H^1(Mobius strip) = Z, and H^2(Mobius strip) = 0.

 # De Rham's theorem
- De Rham's theorem states that any smooth manifold can be obtained by gluing together a set of charts using the de Rham complex.
- This theorem provides a way to compute the de Rham cohomology groups of a manifold by breaking it down into smaller pieces and computing the cohomology groups of each piece separately.

 # Sheaf-theoretic de Rham isomorphism
- The sheaf-theoretic de Rham isomorphism is a way to compute the de Rham cohomology groups of a manifold using sheaves.
- This isomorphism provides a way to relate the de Rham cohomology groups of a manifold to the sheaf cohomology groups of the manifold.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Proof**
- The proof of De Rham's theorem involves constructing a sheaf on the manifold and using the sheaf-theoretic de Rham isomorphism to compute the de Rham cohomology groups of the manifold.
- The construction of the sheaf is based on the idea of a partition of unity, which is a set of functions that are defined on each chart of the manifold and have certain properties.

- It has applications in physics, particularly in the study of gauge theories and gravitational physics.

- They play an important role in the study of de Rham cohomology and have applications in physics, particularly in the study of gauge theories.
