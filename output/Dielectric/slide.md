<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Terminology
- Dielectric: a material that can store electrical charge
- Permittivity: the ability of a material to support an electric field
- Susceptibility: the ability of a material to change in response to an external electric field


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Electric Susceptibility
- Measured by the change in permittivity (Δε) due to an applied electric field (E)
- Units: C/m² (Coulombs per square meter)

 # Dispersion and Causality

- Dispersion: the dependence of permittivity on frequency
- Causality: the relationship between the dielectric properties and the molecular structure
