 # Introduction to Digital Cameras

- Definition: A digital camera is a device that captures photographs and stores them electronically
- History: Development of digital cameras began in the 1970s, but they did not become widely available until the 1990s

 # Image Sensors
- Definition: An image sensor is a device that captures light and converts it into an electrical signal
- Types of image sensors: CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)
- Sensor resolution: Measured in megapixels (MP), with higher resolutions resulting in more detailed images
