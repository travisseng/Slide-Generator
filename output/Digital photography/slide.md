 # Introduction
- Digital photography has revolutionized the way we capture and share images
- From smartphone cameras to professional-grade DSLRs, digital photography has become ubiquitous


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # History of Digital Photography
- The first digital camera was invented in the 1970s
- Early digital cameras were expensive and limited in their capabilities
- Over time, technology improved and digital cameras became more affordable and accessible

 # Digital Camera Basics
- A digital camera consists of a lens, image sensor, and processing software
- The image sensor captures light and converts it into electrical signals
- The processing software interprets the signals and produces a digital image

 # Image Sensors
- CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) sensors were once widely used, but have largely been replaced by CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) sensors
- CMOS sensors are more compact and consume less power

 # Multifunctionality and Connectivity
- Modern digital cameras often have multiple functions, such as video recording, GPS, and Wi-Fi capabilities
- Connectivity features allow for easy sharing and transfer of images


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Performance Metrics

- Image quality is evaluated based on factors such as resolution, dynamic range, and noise levels
- Resolution refers to the number of pixels in an image
- Dynamic range represents the difference between light and dark areas in an image
- Noise is undesirable artifacts that can appear in digital images

 # **Pixel Counts**

- The number of pixels in an image directly impacts its resolution and overall quality
- Higher pixel counts generally lead to better image quality

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Dynamic Range**

- Dynamic range represents the difference between light and dark areas in an image
- A higher dynamic range allows for more detail in both bright and dark areas

 # Advantages in Professional Digital Cameras

- Professional digital cameras offer higher image quality, more advanced features, and greater customization options
- These cameras are designed for serious photographers who demand the best possible results

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Disadvantages of Digital Cameras_

- One disadvantage of digital cameras is that they can be prone to image noise and other artifacts
- Additionally, the sheer volume of images produced by digital cameras can make it difficult to manage and store them all

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Equivalent Features
- Some features that are equivalent across different types of cameras include resolution, dynamic range, and noise levels
- However, other features such as autofocus and burst mode may differ between models


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Frame Aspect Ratios

- Different frame aspect ratios can be used to create different effects and moods in images
- Common aspect ratios include 4:3, 16:9, and 1:1
