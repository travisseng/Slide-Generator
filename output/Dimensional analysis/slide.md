 # Introduction to Dimensional Analysis
- Formulation: starting from physical laws and concepts, we can formulate mathematical equations that describe the behavior of physical systems.
- Rayleigh's method: a systematic approach to analyzing physical systems by identifying the fundamental units of measurement and combining them in a way that is consistent with the principles of physics.

 # Concrete Numbers and Base Units
- Concrete numbers: specific values of quantities that can be measured or observed.
- Base units: fundamental units of measurement that cannot be further divided. Examples include meter, kilogram, second.
- Percentages: a way of expressing a quantity as a fraction of 100.
