 # Introduction to Direct Current (DC)
- Definition: DC refers to the flow of electric charge in one direction only, as opposed to alternating current (AC) which flows in both directions.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # History of DC
- Invention of the first DC battery by Alessandro Volta in 1800
- Early use of DC for telegraphs and telephones
- Development of DC power systems for electric lighting and motorized transportation

 # Various Definitions of DC
- Direct current: a flow of electric charge in one direction only
- Constant voltage: the voltage remains constant over time
- Steady-state current: the current flows in one direction without any reversal


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Circuits**

- DC circuits are made up of sources (batteries or generators), wires, and loads (such as lights or motors)
- The flow of electric charge is in one direction only, from the source to the load

 # Applications of DC

- Domestic and commercial buildings: DC is used for lighting, heating, and powering electronic devices
- Automotive: DC is used to start and power vehicles, such as cars and trucks
- Telecommunication: DC is used in telephone systems and data communication networks
- High-voltage power transmission: DC is used in high-voltage transmission lines for long-distance power transfer
