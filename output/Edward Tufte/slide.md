 # _Information Design_
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Tufte's work focuses on the design of complex information displays, such as charts, graphs, and maps
- He is a proponent of "small multiples," or the use of multiple small graphics to display data instead of one large graphic
- He also advocates for the use of "sparklines," or small lines that represent trends over time

 # Criticism of PowerPoint

- Tufte is critical of PowerPoint and other presentation software, which he believes can lead to the oversimplification and distortion of information
- He argues that these tools can encourage the creation of "chartjunk," or unnecessary visual elements that detract from the message being conveyed

 # Small Multiples
- Tufte's concept of small multiples involves using multiple small graphics to display data instead of one large graphic
- This approach allows for a more detailed and nuanced view of the data, and can help to avoid the oversimplification of complex information

 # Sparkline
- A sparkline is a small line that represents a trend over time
- Tufte advocates for the use of sparklines to provide a quick and easy-to-understand visual representation of data

 # Sculpture
- Tufte has also explored the relationship between information design and sculpture, arguing that both fields involve the creation of three-dimensional forms that can be experienced by the viewer
- He has created several sculptures that incorporate information visualization techniques, such as his "Wall of Words" installation
