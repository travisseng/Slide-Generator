 # Details
- Einstein Cross is a gravitational lens system located in the constellation of Cancer
- It consists of a galaxy cluster and a background galaxy aligned in such a way that their light is bent by the gravity of the cluster, creating multiple images of the background galaxy
- The system was discovered in 2015 by a team of astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope

 # Gallery
- Image 1: An artist's illustration of Einstein Cross, showing the aligned galaxy cluster and background galaxy
- Image 2: A close-up view of one of the multiple images of the background galaxy, created by the gravitational lensing effect of the cluster
- Image 3: A composite image of Einstein Cross, combining visible light and gravitational lensing effects to create a unique view of this cosmic phenomenon
