 # **Overview**
- Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that governs the behavior of charged particles and their interactions.
- Understanding electric charge is essential for understanding many phenomena in the natural world, including lightning, static electricity, and the operation of electronic devices.

 # Unit
- Electric charge is measured in Coulombs (C), with one coulomb being the quantity of electric charge that flows through a conductor in one second.
- The unit of electric charge is defined such that the elementary charge, which is the minimum amount of electric charge that can be carried by a particle, is 1.6 x 10^-19 C.

- The concept of electric charge dates back to ancient Greece, where it was observed that rubbing amber against certain materials could create a static electric charge.
- In the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists such as William Gilbert and Benjamin Franklin conducted experiments that helped to establish the fundamental properties of electric charge.

 # The role of charge in static electricity
- Static electricity is caused by the buildup of electric charge on the surface of objects.
- When two objects with different electronegativities are rubbed together, electrons can be transferred from one object to the other, resulting in a net transfer of electric charge.
- The amount of electric charge that is transferred depends on the materials involved and the conditions of the interaction.

 # Electrification by friction
- Friction is a common method for generating static electricity.
- When two objects are rubbed together, electrons can be transferred from one object to the other, resulting in a net transfer of electric charge.
- The amount of electric charge that is transferred depends on the materials involved and the conditions of the interaction.

 # The role of charge in electric current
- Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor.
- The amount of electric charge that flows through a conductor per unit time is defined as the current.
- The direction of the current is determined by the convention that positive charges move in one direction and negative charges move in the opposite direction.

 # _Conservation of electric charge_
- The total amount of electric charge in a closed system remains constant over time.
- This means that electric charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred from one object to another.
- The conservation of electric charge is a fundamental principle that underlies many phenomena in the natural world.

 # Relativistic invariance

- The laws of physics that govern the behavior of charged particles are independent of the reference frame in which they are observed.
- This means that the properties of electric charge are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.
- The relativistic invariance of electric charge is a fundamental principle that underlies many phenomena in the natural world.

I hope this slide presentation helps to provide an overview of Electric Charge! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
