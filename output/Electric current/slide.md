 # **Electric current**

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction

- Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor
- Measured in amperes (A)

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Symbols and Conventions
- Symbol for electric current: I
- Convention: positive direction of current is from the positive terminal of the power source to the negative terminal


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Reference Direction_

- Reference direction is the direction in which the current flows
- Important for understanding the direction of flow and the sense of the magnetic field generated by the current

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Ohm's Law
- Relationship between voltage, current, and resistance: V = I x R
- Where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Alternating and Direct Current

- Alternating current (AC) is a current that changes direction periodically
- Direct current (DC) is a current that flows in one direction only

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Occurrences of Electric Current
- Electric current occurs in a variety of situations, including:

+ Flow of electrons through a conductor

+ Movement of charged particles in a plasma

+ Magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Measurement of Electric Current

- Measured using an ammeter
- Can be measured by measuring the voltage across a known resistance

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Resistive Heating_

- When an electric current flows through a conductor, it encounters resistance and generates heat
- This is known as resistive heating

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Electromagnetism**
- Electric current creates a magnetic field
- The strength of the magnetic field depends on the size of the current and the distance from the conductor


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Electromagnet**
- An electromagnet is a coil of wire wrapped around a core material that is capable of generating a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it
