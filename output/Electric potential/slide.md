 # Introduction
- Electric potential is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the energy associated with the configuration of electric charges in a system.
- Electric potential is measured in units of voltage (V), and it is a scalar quantity.

 # Electrostatics
- Electrostatics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of stationary electric charges.
- Electric potential is a fundamental concept in electrostatics, as it allows us to calculate the energy of a system of electric charges.

 # Electric potential due to a point charge
- The electric potential due to a point charge can be calculated using Coulomb's law.
- The equation for the electric potential due to a point charge is:

V = k \* q / r

where V is the electric potential, k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q is the point charge, and r is the distance between the point charge and the location where we want to calculate the electric potential.

 # Generalization to electrodynamics

- Electrodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of moving electric charges.
- The concept of electric potential is still important in electrodynamics, as it allows us to calculate the energy of a system of electric charges in motion.

 # Gauge freedom
- Gauge freedom is the idea that the electric potential can be chosen arbitrarily within a given system.
- This means that we can choose different reference frames for calculating the electric potential, and the results will be the same.

 # Units

- The units of electric potential are voltage (V), which is defined as the difference in electric potential between two points.
- Other common units used to express electric potential include millivolts (mV) and volts (V).

 # Galvani potential versus electrochemical potential
- The Galvani potential is the electric potential difference between two metal electrodes immersed in a conducting solution.
- The electrochemical potential is the electric potential difference between two metal electrodes immersed in a conducting solution, taking into account the chemical reactions that occur at the electrodes.
- The Galvani potential and the electrochemical potential are related, but they are not the same thing.

- Understanding electric potential is important for understanding a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of electrons in atoms to the operation of electrical devices.
