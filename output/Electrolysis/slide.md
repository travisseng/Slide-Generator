 # Electrolysis

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Etymology

- Electrolysis comes from the Greek words "electros" meaning "amber-like" and "lysis" meaning "dissolution"
- The term was coined by Michael Faraday in 1834 to describe the decomposition of salt (sodium chloride) using electricity

 # _History_
- Electrolysis has been around for over 200 years, with the first experiments conducted by Alessandro Volta in 1800
- In the early 1800s, electrolysis was used to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, and later to produce aluminum
- Today, electrolysis is used in a variety of industries, including chemical production, water treatment, and energy storage

 # Overview
- Electrolysis is the process of using electricity to drive a chemical reaction
- The reaction involves the transfer of electrons between two substances, resulting in the formation of new compounds
- Electrolysis can be used to decompose, purify, or produce materials


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Process of Electrolysis

- A direct current (DC) is applied to an electrolyte solution using an anode and a cathode
- The DC causes the electrolyte to split into its constituent parts, creating gas bubbles at the electrodes
- The gas bubbles are collected and removed, leaving behind a new compound

 # Decomposition Potential

- The decomposition potential is the voltage required to decompose a substance using electrolysis
- The decomposition potential varies depending on the substance being decomposed
- A higher voltage is required for more complex compounds

 # Oxidation and Reduction at the Electrodes
- At the anode, oxidation occurs as electrons are transferred from the electrode to the electrolyte
- At the cathode, reduction occurs as electrons are transferred from the electrolyte to the electrode
- The oxidation and reduction reactions result in the formation of new compounds

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Energy Changes during Electrolysis
- The energy changes during electrolysis depend on the substances being decomposed and the voltage applied
- The reaction can be exothermic (heat-releasing) or endothermic (heat-absorbing)
- The energy changes can be used to calculate the efficiency of the electrolysis process
