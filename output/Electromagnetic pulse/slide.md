<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # General Characteristics
- EMP is a high-powered electromagnetic radiation that can cause damage to electronic systems and infrastructure
- Can be caused by natural (lightning) or man-made (nuclear explosions, electrostatic discharge) sources
- Can affect a wide range of frequencies, from low frequency audio signals to high frequency radio waves


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Types of Energy**
- Electromagnetic energy can be classified into two types: directed energy and scattered energy
- Directed energy is focused and has a specific direction, while scattered energy is more widespread and can come from any direction

- Can produce pulses in the range of 1 to 10 nanoseconds
- Can affect electronic systems and infrastructure within a radius of several centimeters


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (NEMP)_
- NEMP is a high-powered electromagnetic pulse produced by a nuclear explosion
- Can produce pulses in the range of 1 to 100 nanoseconds
- Can affect electronic systems and infrastructure within a radius of several kilometers


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **Non-Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (NNEMP)**
- NNEMP is a high-powered electromagnetic pulse produced by non-nuclear sources such as electrostatic discharge or switching pulses
- Can produce pulses in the range of 1 to 10 nanoseconds
- Can affect electronic systems and infrastructure within a radius of several centimeters
