 # Definition

- Electromagnetic stress-energy tensor: a rank-2 tensor that describes the electromagnetic field and its associated stress and energy densities
- Also known as the Maxwell stress-energy tensor or the electromagnetic field stress-energy tensor

---

 # SI Units

- The stress-energy tensor is typically expressed in units of energy (e.g. J/m^3) and time (e.g. s)
- In CGS unit conventions, the stress-energy tensor is expressed in units of erg/cm^3 and s

 # CGS Unit Conventions

- In CGS unit conventions, the electromagnetic field is described by the electric and magnetic fields, which are related to the stress-energy tensor by Maxwell's equations
- The stress-energy tensor is then expressed in terms of these fields, rather than directly in terms of energy and time

 # Algebraic Properties

- The stress-energy tensor obeys a number of algebraic properties, including linearity, antisymmetry, and conservation of energy and momentum
- These properties are important for understanding the behavior of the electromagnetic field and its interaction with matter
