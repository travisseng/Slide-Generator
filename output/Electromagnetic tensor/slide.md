 # Electromagnetic tensor

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Definition_

- The electromagnetic tensor is a mathematical object that describes the electromagnetic field in a way that is invariant under Lorentz transformations.
- It is a second-rank tensor, meaning it has two indices that can be raised or lowered using the metric tensor.

 # Relationship with the classical fields

- The electromagnetic tensor can be thought of as a generalization of the electric and magnetic fields of classical electromagnetism.
- In the low-energy limit, the electromagnetic tensor reduces to the familiar electric and magnetic fields.

 # Properties

- The electromagnetic tensor has several important properties, including:

+ Lorentz invariance: The tensor transforms under Lorentz transformations in a way that is consistent with special relativity.

+ Antisymmetry: The tensor is antisymmetric in its indices, meaning that the order of the indices matters.

+ Conservation of energy and momentum: The tensor conserves both energy and momentum for electromagnetic waves.

 # **Relativity**

- The electromagnetic tensor is central to the study of special relativity, as it describes the electromagnetic field in a way that is invariant under Lorentz transformations.
- In the context of general relativity, the tensor is used to describe the gravitational field of a source, and its properties are related to the source's energy and momentum.

 # Lagrangian formulation of classical electromagnetism
- The Lagrangian formulation of classical electromagnetism is based on the idea of treating the electromagnetic field as a dynamical entity that interacts with charged particles.
- The Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field is given by the Maxwell-Lorentz equation, which describes the behavior of the field in terms of its electric and magnetic components.

 # Hamiltonian formulation of classical electromagnetism

- The Hamiltonian formulation of classical electromagnetism is based on the idea of treating the electromagnetic field as a set of oscillators that can be described using the Hamiltonian equation.
- This approach provides a different perspective on the behavior of the electromagnetic field, and it can be useful for studying certain aspects of the field in more detail.

 # Quantum electrodynamics and field theory

- Quantum electrodynamics is a quantum field theory that describes the behavior of the electromagnetic field in terms of its quantum fluctuations.
- The theory is based on the idea of treating the electromagnetic field as a set of quantized oscillators, and it provides a framework for understanding the behavior of the field at very small distances and high energies.

 # Notes
- The electromagnetic tensor has a rich structure that can be studied using a variety of mathematical techniques, including differential geometry and group theory.
- The tensor is closely related to other important mathematical objects, such as the Riemann curvature tensor and the gauge field strength tensor.
