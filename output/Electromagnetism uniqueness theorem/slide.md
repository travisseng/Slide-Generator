 # **Maxwell's Equations**
- Maxwell's equations are a set of four partial differential equations that describe the behavior of the electromagnetic field in space and time.
- The equations are:

+ Gauss's law for electric fields: ∇⋅E = ρ/ε0 (where E is the electric field, ρ is the charge density, and ε0 is the electric constant)

+ Gauss's law for magnetic fields: ∇⋅B = 0 (where B is the magnetic field)

+ Faraday's law of induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (where E is the electric field and B is the magnetic field)

+ Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction: ∇×B = μ0J + μ0ε0 ∂E/∂t (where B is the magnetic field, J is the current density, ε0 is the electric constant, and μ0 is the magnetic constant)

 # The Electromagnetism Uniqueness Theorem
- The Electromagnetism Uniqueness Theorem states that, given a set of boundary conditions on a domain D in spacetime, there exists at most one solution to Maxwell's equations within the domain.
- The theorem is based on the idea that the electromagnetic field satisfies a set of wave-like equations, and therefore can only have one solution for each set of boundary conditions.

 # Assumptions of the Theorem
- The Electromagnetism Uniqueness Theorem relies on several assumptions about the domain D and the boundary conditions:

+ D is a simply connected, open set in spacetime.

+ The boundary conditions are specified on the boundary of D.

+ The boundary conditions are consistent with the constraints imposed by Maxwell's equations.
