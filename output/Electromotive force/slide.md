 # Electromotive force

 # Overview

- EMF is the driving force behind electric current flow in a circuit
- Also known as voltage, it is measured in volts (V)

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **History**

- First recognized and studied by Alessandro Volta in the late 18th century
- Named after him, "voltage" is the potential difference between two points in a circuit

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Notation and Units of Measurement
- Symbol: V
- Unit: volts (V) = joules/coulomb (J/C)


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Formal Definitions

- EMF is the difference in energy per unit charge between two points in a circuit
- It is the work done per unit charge to move a test charge from one point to another

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # In (Electrochemical) Thermodynamics
- EMF is related to the Gibbs free energy of a system
- Helps to determine the spontaneity of chemical reactions and electrochemical processes


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Distinction with Potential Difference_

- Potential difference (PD) is the difference in electric potential between two points in a circuit
- EMF is the driving force behind the flow of current, while PD is the difference in potential that can drive current

 # Generation
- EMF can be generated by various sources, including:

+ Chemical reactions (e.g., batteries)

+ Electromagnetic induction (e.g., generators)

+ Other sources (e.g., solar cells)

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Chemical Sources
- Batteries and fuel cells are examples of chemical sources that generate EMF
- They work by converting chemical energy into electrical energy

 # **Voltaic Cells**
- Also known as galvanic cells, these devices convert chemical energy into electrical energy
- Examples include batteries and fuel cells


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Typical Values

- EMF values for common sources:

+ Battery: 1.5 V - 9 V

+ Solar cell: 0.5 V - 2 V

+ Generator: 100 V - 1000 V

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Other Chemical Sources

- Other sources of EMF include:

+ Photocells (e.g., solar cells)

+ Thermocouples

+ Piezoelectric devices

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Electromagnetic Induction**
- EMF can also be generated by electromagnetic induction, such as in generators and transformers
- This process involves the transfer of energy between two circuits through a magnetic field


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Contact Potentials**

- When two different metals are in contact with each other, they can exchange electrons and generate an EMF
- Examples include the contact potential difference (CPD) and the corrosion potential difference (CPD)

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Solar Cells**

- Solar cells convert sunlight into electrical energy
- They work by converting photons into electrons, which then flow through the circuit to generate EMF

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Solar Cell Current-Voltage Relationship
- The current-voltage relationship for a solar cell is nonlinear and depends on factors such as light intensity and temperature
- The maximum power point is the point at which the solar cell produces its maximum power output
