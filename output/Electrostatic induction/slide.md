 # Electrostatic induction

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Explanation

Electrostatic induction is the process by which an electrostatic charge is induced on an object when it is brought near another object with an existing charge. This phenomenon is based on Coulomb's Law, which states that like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract each other.

 # _Charging an Object by Induction_
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">


When a charged object is brought near an uncharged object, the electrostatic field of the charged object induces an electric charge on the surface of the uncharged object. The direction of the induced charge depends on the polarity of the charged object and the material of the uncharged object.

 # The Electrostatic Field inside a Conductive Object is Zero
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">


Inside a conductive object, the electrostatic field is zero due to the continuous movement of electrons. This means that there are no permanent electric dipoles inside a conductor, and therefore, no induced charge can be created inside the conductor.

 # Induced Charge Resides on the Surface

The induced charge resides only on the surface of the object and not within the material itself. This is because the electric field penetrates only a short distance into the material before being shielded by the electrons inside the conductor.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # The Voltage throughout a Conductive Object is Constant

The voltage throughout a conductive object is constant, as the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means that there is no potential difference between different points within the conductor, and therefore, no current can flow through it.

 # Induction in Dielectric Objects

Dielectric objects, such as glass or plastic, can also be charged by electrostatic induction. In these materials, the induced charge is not confined to the surface but can penetrate a short distance into the material. This allows for the creation of a non-uniform electric field within the dielectric object.
