 # Introduction to Electrostatics

- Electrostatics is the study of stationary charges and their effects on other charges
- Important in understanding phenomena such as lightning, sparks, and static electricity

 # Coulomb's Law

- Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
- Formulated by French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in 1785
