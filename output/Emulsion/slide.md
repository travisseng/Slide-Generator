 # Emulsion

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Introduction_

- Emulsion: a mixture of two or more liquids that don't normally mix together (e.g. oil and water)
- Importance: widely used in various industries such as food, health care, firefighting, and chemical synthesis

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # **Etymology**
- "Emulsion" comes from the Latin word "emulere," meaning "to stir up" or "to mix"

 # Appearance and Properties
- Emulsions can have a variety of appearances, depending on the components and their proportions
- They can be transparent, opaque, or semi-transparent
- Emulsions can exhibit different properties such as texture, viscosity, and stability


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Instability
- Emulsions are inherently unstable due to the tendency of the components to separate or settle over time
- This can lead to creaming, sedimentation, or phase separation

 # Monitoring Physical Stability
- Important to monitor physical stability of emulsions in order to maintain their quality and functionality
- Techniques for monitoring physical stability include visual inspection, turbidity measurement, and rheology testing

 # Accelerating Methods for Shelf Life Prediction
- Accelerated testing methods can be used to predict the shelf life of emulsions under different conditions
- Examples include temperature accelerated aging (TAA), photo-oxidation, and centrifugation

 # **Emulsifiers**

- Emulsifiers are substances that help to stabilize emulsions by reducing the interfacial tension between the components
- Examples of emulsifiers include soaps, fatty acids, and surfactants

 # **Mechanisms of Emulsification**

- There are several mechanisms of emulsification, including:

+ Hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction

+ Electrostatic attraction

+ Steric stabilization

+ Demixing
