 # Cosmic Event Horizon

- Definition: A cosmic event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of a massive object.
- Example: The event horizon of a black hole.

- Definition: The apparent horizon of an accelerated particle is the boundary beyond which the particle's future light cones no longer intersect with its past light cones.
- Example: An object moving at high speed through space.

 # Interacting with a Cosmic Horizon

- Definition: Interacting with a cosmic horizon means that an object or observer is so close to the horizon that the gravitational pull of the massive object is strong enough to affect their motion.
- Example: A spacecraft approaching a black hole.

 # Event Horizon of a Black Hole

- Definition: The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.
- Example: The point of no return for anything that crosses the horizon.

 # Interacting with Black Hole Horizons
- Definition: Interacting with a black hole horizon means that an object or observer is so close to the event horizon that the gravitational pull of the black hole is strong enough to affect their motion.
- Example: A spacecraft approaching a black hole, or an object being pulled towards a black hole.

 # **Beyond General Relativity**

- Definition: Beyond general relativity refers to theories and models that go beyond the current understanding of gravity and the behavior of massive objects.
- Examples: Quantum gravity, string theory, loop quantum gravity.
