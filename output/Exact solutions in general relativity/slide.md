<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Background and Definition

- General Relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein
- GR describes the gravitational force as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy
- Exact solutions in GR refer to specific solutions that describe a particular physical situation, such as the motion of a planet or the collapse of a star

 # Difficulties with the Definition
- Finding exact solutions in GR is challenging due to the non-linear and non-perturbative nature of the theory
- Many solutions are difficult to obtain in closed form, and often require numerical methods or approximate solutions
- The difficulty in finding exact solutions has led to the development of alternative approaches, such as numerical relativity and approximation techniques

 # Types of Exact Solutions

- There are several types of exact solutions in GR, including:

+ Schwarzschild metric (describing a stationary black hole)

+ Kerr metric (describing a rotating black hole)

+ Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric (describing the evolution of the universe)

+ Vaidya metric (describing a dynamical black hole)

 # Examples

- Some notable examples of exact solutions in GR include:

+ The Schwarzschild solution, which describes the spacetime around a stationary black hole

+ The Kerr solution, which describes the spacetime around a rotating black hole

+ The FLRW solution, which describes the evolution of the universe in the presence of matter and radiation

 # Constructing Solutions
- Exact solutions in GR can be constructed using various methods, including:

+ The Einstein field equations, which relate the curvature of spacetime to the mass-energy density of the system

+ The Hamiltonian constraint, which relates the curvature of spacetime to the momentum of the system

+ Numerical methods, such as finite difference or finite element methods

 # Existence of Solutions

- The existence of exact solutions in GR is a fundamental question in the field, and has been the subject of much research and debate
- Many exact solutions are known to exist, but there may be additional solutions that have not yet been discovered
- The existence of exact solutions is important for understanding the behavior of gravitational systems, and for testing the predictions of GR

 # Global Stability Theorems
- Global stability theorems in GR provide conditions under which a solution can be guaranteed to be stable over time
- These theorems are important for understanding the long-term behavior of gravitational systems, and for predicting the stability of astrophysical objects such as black holes and neutron stars
