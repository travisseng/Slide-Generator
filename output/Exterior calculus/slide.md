 # **Introduction**
- Exterior calculus is a mathematical framework for studying smooth manifolds and their properties
- Developed by mathematicians such as Elie Cartan, Jean Leray, and Shoshichi Nakahara

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # History

- Early beginnings in the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss and William Rowan Hamilton
- Later developed by Henri Poincar√© and Emmy Noether
- Influenced by the development of differential geometry and topology

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Concept

- Exterior calculus is a way of studying smooth manifolds using exterior algebra and integration
- Uses the concept of a "exterior derivative" to study properties of manifolds
- Related to but distinct from the interior calculus of differential equations

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Integration and Orientation

- Exterior calculus uses a notion of integration that is different from the usual Riemann integral
- Instead, it uses the concept of a "exterior form" to integrate over manifolds
- This allows for the integration of more complex functions and tensors on manifolds

 # **Multi-Index Notation**

- Exterior calculus uses multi-index notation to represent tensors and forms on manifolds
- This notation allows for a concise and elegant way of representing mathematical objects on manifolds
