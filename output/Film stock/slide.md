 # History of Film Stock

- 1888-1899: Before standardization
- 1900-1919: Toward the standard picture film
- 1920s: Diversification of film sensitivity

 # _Early Film Stock (1888-1899)_
- Invented by William Friese-Greene and Charles Francis Jenkins
- First films were made on paper coated with a light-sensitive emulsion
- Experimental and unstandardized, leading to inconsistent results

 # **Standardization of Film Stock (1900-1919)**

- Eastman Kodak introduces the first standard picture film
- Development of panchromatic emulsions for greater sensitivity
- Introduction of celluloid base for increased durability

 # _Diversification of Film Sensitivity (1920s)_

- Development of specialized film stocks for specific applications (e.g. high-speed films, low-light films)
- Increased demand for color films and the introduction of sound films

 # _Color Films_

- First color films were introduced in the early 1900s
- Development of subtractive color systems (Kodachrome, Agfacolor)
- Introduction of additive color systems (Technicolor)
