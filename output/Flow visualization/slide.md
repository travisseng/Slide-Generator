 # Overview

- Definition of flow visualization: the process of creating graphical representations of data to better understand and analyze the flow of materials, products, or information.
- Importance of flow visualization: helps identify inefficiencies, improve processes, and increase productivity.

- Sankey diagrams: illustrate the flow of materials or energy through a system, using arrows and widths to represent quantities.
- Flow maps: show the movement of people, goods, or information over time and space, often using different colors or shapes to represent different types of flows.
- Material flow diagrams: depict the consumption and production of materials within a system, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- Network diagrams: show the interconnectedness of different components within a system, such as supply chains or communication networks.

 # _Application_
- Manufacturing: flow visualization can help optimize production processes, reduce waste, and improve product quality.
- Logistics: visualizing the flow of goods and materials through a distribution network can help identify bottlenecks and improve delivery times.
- Information technology: flow visualization can be used to understand and optimize the flow of data through computer networks, improving system performance and security.
- Healthcare: visualizing the flow of patients and medical resources can help identify areas for improvement in patient care and hospital operations.

 # Benefits of Flow Visualization
- Improved process understanding: flow visualization helps stakeholders understand complex processes and identify opportunities for improvement.
- Increased productivity: by identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies, flow visualization can help increase productivity and reduce waste.
- Better decision-making: with a clear visual representation of the flow of materials or information, stakeholders can make more informed decisions about how to optimize processes and improve outcomes.
