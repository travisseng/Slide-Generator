 # Four-potential

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Definition
- The four potentials in gauge theory are the scalar potential, the vector potential, the axial-vector potential, and the mixed potential.
- These potentials describe the dynamics of the gauge fields and their interactions with matter.

 # _In the Lorenz Gauge_
- The Lorenz gauge is a particular choice of gauge that is often used in the study of gauge theories.
- In this gauge, the vector potential is set to zero, and the axial-vector potential is set to the negative of the scalar potential.
- This gauge is useful because it simplifies the equations of motion and makes it easier to analyze the properties of the theory.

 # _Gauge Freedom_

- Gauge freedom is the ability to choose a different gauge, or coordinate system, in which to describe the same physical phenomena.
- In gauge theories, the choice of gauge can affect the results of calculations, so it is important to choose a gauge that is appropriate for the problem at hand.
- The four potentials are independent of the gauge choice, and can be used to describe the physics of the theory in any gauge.

 # Conclusion
- The four potentials in gauge theory provide a complete description of the dynamics of the gauge fields and their interactions with matter.
- The Lorenz gauge is a useful choice for studying gauge theories, but other gauges may also be appropriate depending on the problem at hand.
- Gauge freedom is an important aspect of gauge theories, and allows us to choose the most convenient gauge for each situation.
