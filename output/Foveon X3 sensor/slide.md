- The Foveon X3 sensor is made up of three layers of photodiodes, each layer capturing a different color (red, green, and blue) of light.
- Each pixel is made up of four photodiodes, one for each color, which allows for higher spatial resolution and better color accuracy.

 # Comparison to Bayer-filter sensors

- The Foveon X3 sensor does not use a Bayer filter, which is a layer of color filters that is typically applied to other types of digital image sensors.
- This allows for better color accuracy and more efficient light gathering, as the sensor can capture the full spectrum of light without any filtering.

 # Color artifacts

- One potential drawback of the Foveon X3 sensor is the presence of color artifacts, such as purple fringing or moir√© patterns.
- These artifacts can be minimized with proper image processing and correction techniques.
