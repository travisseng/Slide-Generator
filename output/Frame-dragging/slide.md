 # Introduction

- Brief overview of frame-dragging and its significance in general relativity

 # Effects

Frame-dragging has several important effects on spacetime:
- Curvature of spacetime: Frame-dragging causes spacetime to curve, which can affect the motion of objects near the rotating body.
- Alteration of local laws of physics: The presence of frame-dragging can alter the local laws of physics, such as the speed of light and the strength of gravity.

These effects are important for understanding phenomena such as gravitational waves and the behavior of black holes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can assist with.
