 # Friedmann equations

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Assumptions

- The Friedmann equations are based on the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe
- This means that the universe is the same in all directions and at all points in time

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Equations**
- The Friedmann equations describe the evolution of the universe as a function of time
- The equations take into account the curvature of space-time, the density of matter, and the pressure of matter

 # Density Parameter
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- The density parameter (Î³) is a key component of the Friedmann equations
- It represents the ratio of the density of matter to the critical density

 # Useful Solutions
- The Friedmann equations have several useful solutions, including the flat, open, and closed universes
- Each solution corresponds to a different curvature of space-time

 # Mixtures
- The Friedmann equations can be used to model mixtures of matter and radiation
- This is important for understanding the early universe and the formation of structure

 # _Detailed Derivation_

- The Friedmann equations can be derived in detail using the Einstein field equations
- This provides a more fundamental understanding of the equations and their physical significance

 # **Rescaled Friedmann Equation**

- The rescaled Friedmann equation is a simplified version of the original equations
- It is often used to study the large-scale structure of the universe and the formation of galaxies

 # **In Popular Culture**

- The Friedmann equations have been featured in several popular culture references, including books, movies, and TV shows
- They are often used as a symbol of scientific discovery and the search for knowledge

 # Notes

- The Friedmann equations are a fundamental tool for understanding the evolution of the universe
- They provide a framework for studying the large-scale structure of the universe and the formation of galaxies
