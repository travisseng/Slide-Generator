 # Works

- Contributed to the understanding of electromagnetic waves and their properties
- Developed Savart's Law, which describes the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire
- Proposed the idea of the "electric fluid" that flows through conductors and is responsible for the flow of electricity
- Collaborated with other scientists, such as André-Marie Ampère, to advance the understanding of electromagnetism

 # _Savart's Law_
- States that the magnetic field at any point in space is proportional to the current flowing through a wire and the distance between the point and the wire
- Mathematically expressed as B = μ₀ \* I / r, where B is the magnetic field strength, I is the current flowing through the wire, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, and r is the distance between the point and the wire
