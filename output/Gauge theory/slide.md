<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # History
- Gauge theory has its roots in the early 20th century with the work of Cartan, Ã‰lie and Yang
- Developed further by physicists such as Dirac, Yang, Mills, and Weinberg
- Today, gauge theory is a fundamental tool for understanding particle physics and field theories

 # _Description_

- Gauge theory is a mathematical framework for describing symmetries in physical systems
- Based on the idea of local transformations that preserve the laws of physics
- Applies to a wide range of physical phenomena, from electromagnetism to quantum field theory

 # Global and Local Symmetries

- Global symmetries: transformations that act on all points in space and time
- Local symmetries: transformations that act on individual points in space and time
- Gauge theory is concerned with local symmetries
