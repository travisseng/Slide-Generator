 # _Gauss's law_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Qualitative Description

- Gauss's law is a fundamental principle in electrostatics that relates the distribution of electric charge to the resulting electric field.
- The law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed within the surface.

 # _Equation Involving the E Field_

- The equation involving the electric field (E) can be written as:

∇ · E = ρ/εo

where ρ is the electric charge density and εo is the vacuum permittivity.

 # Integral Form
- The integral form of Gauss's law for total charge can be written as:

∇ · E = ∫∫ρ(r)dA

where dA is the area element and r is a point on the surface.

 # Differential Form
- The differential form of Gauss's law for total charge can be written as:

∇ · E = -∂φ/∂x + ∂ψ/∂y + ∂γ/∂z

where φ, ψ, and γ are the potential functions.

 # Equivalence of Integral and Differential Forms

- The integral and differential forms of Gauss's law are equivalent, meaning that they both describe the same physical phenomenon.
- The integral form is more commonly used in practice, while the differential form is more useful for theoretical analysis.

 # Free, Bound, and Total Charge

- Free charge is the charge that is not bound to any particular object or system.
- Bound charge is the charge that is bound to a particular object or system.
- Total charge is the sum of all the free and bound charges within a given system.

 # Equivalence of Total and Free Charge Statements

- The total charge statement and the free charge statement are equivalent, meaning that they both describe the same physical phenomenon.
- The total charge statement is more commonly used in practice, while the free charge statement is more useful for theoretical analysis.

 # Equation for Linear Materials

- The equation for linear materials can be written as:

E = (εo + χ)∇(ρ/εo)

where εo is the vacuum permittivity, χ is the linear susceptibility, and ρ is the electric charge density.

 # **Interpretations**
- Gauss's law can be interpreted as a statement of conservation of electric charge, meaning that the total electric charge within a given system remains constant over time.
- Gauss's law can also be interpreted as a statement of the fundamental relationship between electric fields and charges, providing a foundation for understanding many other phenomena in electrostatics.

 # Relation to Coulomb's Law
- Gauss's law is closely related to Coulomb's law, which describes the force between two charged objects.
- Coulomb's law can be derived from Gauss's law, and vice versa.

 # Deriving Gauss's Law from Coulomb's Law

- To derive Gauss's law from Coulomb's law, we start with the equation for the force between two charged objects:

F = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}

where k is Coulomb's constant, q_1 and q_2 are the charges of the objects, and r is the distance between them.
