<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction

- Gaussian units are an alternative system of units used in electrical engineering and physics
- Gaussian units are based on the Gaussian system of measurement, which is a consistent and rationalized system for describing electromagnetic phenomena

 # _Alternative unit systems_

- Gaussian units are one of several alternative unit systems used in electrical engineering and physics
- Other unit systems include SI (International System of Units), CGS (CGS system), and MKS (MKS system)

 # Major differences between Gaussian and SI systems
- The most significant difference between Gaussian and SI systems is the unit of charge, which is 1e in Gaussian units and 1C in SI units
- Additionally, Gaussian units use the letter "e" to represent the base of the natural logarithm, while SI units use "E"

 # Rationalized unit systems
- Gaussian units are a rationalized system of units, meaning that all units are defined in terms of a few fundamental constants
- This makes it easy to perform calculations and conversions between different units

 # Unit of charge
- The unit of charge in Gaussian units is 1e, which is defined as the charge of an electron
- This unit is used to describe electrical phenomena, such as the flow of electric current

 # Units for magnetism
- In addition to the unit of charge, there are several other units that are used to describe magnetism in Gaussian units
- These include the unit of magnetic flux (weber), the unit of magnetic field strength (tesla), and the unit of magnetic permeability (henry)

 # Polarization and magnetization
- Polarization and magnetization are two important concepts in electromagnetism that are described using Gaussian units
- Polarization refers to the alignment of electric charges within a material, while magnetization refers to the alignment of magnetic dipoles within a material
