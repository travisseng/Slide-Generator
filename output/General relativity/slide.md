 # **General relativity**

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Introduction_

- General relativity is a theory of gravity developed by Albert Einstein
- It revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # History

- From classical mechanics to general relativity:

+ Newtonian mechanics was the prevailing theory of motion before Einstein's work

+ Einstein's theories of special and general relativity challenged Newtonian assumptions about space and time

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Geometry of Newtonian Gravity
- Classical gravity as a force:

+ Newton's law of universal gravitation describes the gravitational force between objects

+ Gravitational potential energy is a measure of the energy associated with gravitational attraction

- From classical mechanics to general relativity:

+ Special theory of relativity introduced the concept of spacetime and challenged absolute time and space

+ General theory of relativity extended the principles of special relativity to gravitation

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **Einstein's Equations**

- The heart of general relativity:

+ Einstein's field equations describe how matter and energy affect spacetime geometry

+ These equations are a set of non-linear partial differential equations

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Total Force in General Relativity
- Gravitational force as a consequence of spacetime curvature:

+ The total force on an object is the sum of all the forces acting upon it, including gravity

+ In general relativity, gravity is not a force, but rather a consequence of spacetime geometry


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Alternatives to General Relativity
- Other approaches to gravity and spacetime:

+ Brans-Dicke theory: an extension of general relativity that includes a scalar field and changes the nature of the gravitational force

+ Modified theories of gravity: alternatives to general relativity that modify the Einstein field equations to better fit observations or address issues with the theory


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.72em}</style>

 # Definition and Basic Applications
