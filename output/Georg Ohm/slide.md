 # Discovery of Ohm's Law
- Ohm's most famous discovery is his law, which states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it, and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor
- This law, which was first published in 1827, revolutionized the field of electrical engineering and paved the way for the development of modern electronics
- Ohm's law is still widely used today, and is a fundamental principle in the design and operation of electronic circuits

 # **Ohm's Acoustic Law**

- In addition to his work on electricity and physics, Ohm also made significant contributions to the field of acoustics
- He developed a law that describes the relationship between the frequency of a sound wave and its wavelength, which is still used today in the design of musical instruments and other acoustic devices
- Ohm's work in acoustics was an area of particular interest for him, and he spent many years studying the properties of sound and its behavior in different materials
