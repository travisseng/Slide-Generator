 # What is the Golden Triangle?

- The golden triangle is formed by three points: the subject, the focal point, and the entrance point
- These points are connected by lines that form a triangle

 # The Subject

- The subject is the main element of the image
- It should be placed at one corner of the triangle

 # The Focal Point

- The focal point is the point of interest in the image
- It should be placed at the other corner of the triangle, opposite the subject
