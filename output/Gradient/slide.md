 # Notation
- Gradient of a function f(x) is denoted by ∇f(x) or df(x)/dx
- Subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to each variable
- e.g., ∇f = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ..., ∂f/∂n)

 # Conservative Vector Fields and the Gradient Theorem

- Conservative vector fields are fields that have a potential function, and their gradient is proportional to the field
- The gradient theorem states that the gradient of a conservative vector field is a closed form, meaning it has no surface terms
