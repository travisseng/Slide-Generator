 # _Description - "Gravitational lensing is the bending and distortion of light around massive objects, caused by the curvature of spacetime. It allows us to study the properties of dark matter and dark energy, and probe the universe in ways not possible with direct observation."_

 # History - "The concept of gravitational lensing was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, as a prediction of his theory of general relativity. The first observations were made in the 1970s, and since then, it has become a powerful tool for studying the universe."

 # Explanation in terms of spacetime curvature - "Spacetime is not flat, but curved by the presence of mass and energy. The more massive the object, the greater the curvature, and the more pronounced the lensing effects will be. Gravitational lensing allows us to measure this curvature and study the properties of spacetime."

 # Search for gravitational lenses - "Gravitational lenses can be found in a variety of locations, from galaxy clusters to individual galaxies. They are often discovered by analyzing large surveys of astronomical data, looking for anomalies in the shapes of galaxy images."

 # **Solar gravitational lens - "The Sun is a massive object that can act as a gravitational lens, bending and distorting the light from distant stars and galaxies. This effect is known as 'microlensing' and can be used to study the properties of exoplanets and dark matter."**

 # Measuring weak lensing - "Weak lensing is the distortion of galaxy shapes caused by the gravitational field of large-scale structure in the universe. By measuring these distortions, we can infer the distribution of mass in the universe and study the properties of dark matter."

- Einstein, A. (1915). 'Cosmological considerations'. In: S.S. Holland (ed.), Cosmology and the Theory of the Universe. Oxford University Press.
- Walsh, D. (2017). 'Gravitational lensing: A review of the current state of the art'. Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 55, 345-374.
- The Gravitational Lensing Group at the University of California, Berkeley (<https://www.astro.berkeley.edu/eel/lenses/>)

These resources offer a wealth of information on gravitational lensing and its applications in modern astrophysics."

I hope this presentation provides a helpful introduction to the wonders of gravitational lensing!
