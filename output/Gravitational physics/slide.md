 # **Newton's Theory of Gravitation**
- Newton's theory of gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
- The theory provided a mathematical framework for understanding the force of gravity and its effects on astronomical objects

 # Specifics

- Gravity is weaker than the other fundamental forces of nature, but it is always attractive
- The strength of gravity between two objects depends on their mass and the distance between them
- Gravity is responsible for keeping planets in orbit around their stars and for the structure of galaxies

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.80em}</style>

 # **Earth's Gravity**
- The force of gravity on Earth is what keeps us and everything else on its surface
- The strength of gravity on Earth is about 9.8 meters per second squared, or m/s^2
- The Earth's mass and radius determine the strength of its gravitational field

 # Origin
- Gravitational radiation was first proposed by Einstein in 1916 as a consequence of his theory of general relativity
- Scientists have since detected gravitational waves using advanced observatories such as LIGO and Virgo


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Speed of Gravity

- The speed of gravity is the speed at which gravitational forces propagate through spacetime
- According to general relativity, the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light
- This means that the force of gravity does not travel faster than the speed of light, and it takes time for gravitational waves to propagate across vast distances
