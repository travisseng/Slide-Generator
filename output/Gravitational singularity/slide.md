 # Gravitational singularity

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Introduction_
- Definition of a gravitational singularity: a point in space-time where the curvature becomes infinite and the laws of physics as we know them break down
- Importance of understanding singularities in order to better understand the universe and its behavior


---

 # Interpretation
- Different interpretations of singularities, including:

+ Classical singularities: points where the curvature becomes infinite due to the collapse of a star or other mass-energy source

+ Quantum singularities: points where the laws of quantum mechanics break down and the rules of classical physics no longer apply

+ Cosmological singularities: points in the early universe where the density and temperature were infinite, marking the beginning of the universe as we know it today

 # Types of Singularities

- Types of gravitational singularities include:

+ Schwarzschild singularity: a spherically symmetric singularity that forms when a star collapses under its own gravity

+ Kerr singularity: an axisymmetric singularity that forms when a rotating star collapses

+ Reissner-Nordstr√∂m singularity: a singularity that forms when a charged object collapses under its own gravity

 # Conical Singularities

- Conical singularities are singularities that form when a cone-shaped object collapses under its own gravity
- These singularities have a unique structure, with the curvature becoming infinite at the tip of the cone

 # _Curvature_
- Gravitational singularities are characterized by extreme curvature of space-time
- The curvature becomes infinite at the singularity, making it impossible to predict what happens there using classical physics

 # Naked Singularity

- A naked singularity is a singularity that is not hidden within a black hole event horizon
- These singularities are visible from the outside and can be observed by telescopes

 # Entropy

- Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system
- In the context of gravitational singularities, entropy can be used to understand the behavior of matter and energy in the vicinity of the singularity
