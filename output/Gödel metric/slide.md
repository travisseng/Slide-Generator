 # Gödel metric

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Definition
- The Gödel metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the spacetime around a rotating black hole.
- It was discovered by Kurt Gödel in 1962 and is considered one of the most important solutions to the Einstein field equations.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Properties
- The Gödel metric has a number of interesting properties, including:

+ It is stationary and axisymmetric, meaning that it does not change over time or under rotations around the axis of rotation.

+ It has a closed timelike curve, which allows for closed timelike curves in the spacetime.

+ It has a singularity at the center of the black hole, where the curvature becomes infinite.

 # _Einstein Tensor_

- The Einstein tensor is a measure of the curvature of the spacetime and is given by:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R$$

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Topology

- The topology of the Gödel metric is that of a cylinder, with the black hole singularity at the center.
- The spacetime is topologically non-trivial, meaning that it cannot be described by a simply connected space.

 # **Curvature Invariants**

- The curvature invariants of the Gödel metric are:

+ The Riemann tensor: $$R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} = \begin{bmatrix}

0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

0 & -2\Lambda & 0 & 0 \\

0 & 0 & 2\Lambda & 0 \\

0 & 0 & 0 & 0

\end{bmatrix}$$

+ The Ricci tensor: $$R_{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}

2\Lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

0 & -2\Lambda & 0 & 0 \\

0 & 0 & -2\Lambda & 0 \\

0 & 0 & 0 & -2\Lambda

\end{bmatrix}$$

+ The scalar curvature: $\Lambda = \frac{1}{r^2}$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$$

 # _Petrov Type and Bel Decomposition_
- The Petrov type of the Gödel metric is type D, meaning that it has a certain number of Killing vectors and a certain number of commuting Killing vectors.
- The Bel decomposition of the Gödel metric is:

$$g_{\mu\nu} = -e^{2\lambda}dt^2 + e^{2\psi}\left(d\phi^2 + dz^2\right)$$

 # _Rigid Rotation_
- The Gödel metric describes a rotating black hole with a rigid rotation, meaning that the rotation is fixed and does not change over time.

 # Optical Effects

- The optical effects of the Gödel metric are interesting and can be used to study the properties of the spacetime.
- For example, the gravitational lensing effect causes light to bend around the black hole, creating a "gravitational lens" effect.
