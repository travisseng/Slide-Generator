 # Heaviside–Lorentz units

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Motivation
- The Heaviside-Lorentz system of units was developed to provide a consistent and convenient framework for describing the behavior of electromagnetic waves in vacuum and in materials.
- The system is based on two fundamental units: the length-mass-time (LMT) unit and the electric charge.

 # Length–mass–time framework

- In the Heaviside-Lorentz system, the basic units of length, mass, and time are defined as follows:

+ Length (l): The distance between two points in space.

+ Mass (m): A measure of the amount of matter in an object.

+ Time (t): The duration of a process or event.
- These units are related to each other by the following equations:

+ l = m^2 / t^2

+ m = l^3 / t

+ t = l / m^2

 # Comparison of Heaviside-Lorentz with other systems of units

- The Heaviside-Lorentz system is similar to other systems of units, such as the International System of Units (SI), but it has some key differences:

+ The LMT system uses a different set of base units than SI.

+ The LMT system is based on a different set of fundamental physical constants than SI.
- The Heaviside-Lorentz system is more convenient for describing electromagnetic phenomena, while the SI system is more general and widely used.

 # **Maxwell's equations**

- The Heaviside-Lorentz system is based on a set of four equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields:

+ Gauss's law for electric fields: ∇⋅E = ρ / ε0

+ Gauss's law for magnetic fields: ∇⋅B = 0

+ Faraday's law of induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

+ Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction: ∇×B = μ0J + μ0ε0 ∂E/∂t
- These equations are the basis for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves and their interaction with matter.

 # **Other basic laws**
- In addition to Maxwell's equations, there are several other basic laws that are important in the Heaviside-Lorentz system:

+ The Lorentz force law: F = q(E + v × B)

+ The energy-momentum equation: ΔE = ∑ F · dl
- These laws provide a complete framework for understanding the behavior of charged particles and their interaction with electromagnetic fields.

 # Dielectric and magnetic materials

- In the Heaviside-Lorentz system, dielectric and magnetic materials are described using a set of equations that take into account their properties:

+ The dielectric constant (ε) and the magnetic permeability (μ) are related to the electric and magnetic fields by:

∇⋅E = ρ / ε0

∇×B = μ0J

+ The dispersion relation for a material is given by:

ω^2 = ε0 ε - μ0 μ
- These equations provide a complete framework for understanding the behavior of materials in electromagnetic fields.

 # Advantages and disadvantages of Heaviside-Lorentz units
- Advantages:

+ The Heaviside-Lorentz system provides a consistent and convenient framework for describing electromagnetic phenomena.

+ It is well-suited for describing the behavior of charged particles and their interaction with electromagnetic fields.
- Disadvantages:

+ The system is less general than other systems, such as SI, and is only applicable to electromagnetic phenomena.

+ It may not be as well-suited for describing certain types of materials or experimental setups.

 # Translating expressions and formulas between systems

- It is sometimes necessary to translate expressions and formulas between different systems of units:

+ To translate an expression from the Heaviside-Lorentz system to SI, we can use the following conversion factors:

1 m = 3.280846 x 10^(-7) L

1 s = 3.15364 x 10^(-8) t

+ To translate an expression from SI to the Heaviside-Lorentz system, we can use the following conversion factors:

1 L = 299792458 m

1 t = 299792458 s
- These conversion factors allow us to translate expressions and formulas between systems.

 # Notes
- The Heaviside-Lorentz system is a useful framework for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves and their interaction with matter.
- It is based on a set of fundamental physical constants and units that are related to each other in a consistent way.
- The system provides a complete framework for describing electromagnetic phenomena, but it may not be as well-suited for certain types of materials or experimental setups.
