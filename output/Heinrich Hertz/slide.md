 # Electromagnetic waves
- Hertz showed that electricity and magnetism are different aspects of the same physical phenomenon
- Demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields can propagate through space as waves, leading to the development of modern electromagnetic theory
- Explored the properties of electromagnetic waves, such as frequency and wavelength, and their applications in communication and other fields

 # Cathode rays

- Studied the properties of cathode rays, which are streams of electrons emitted from a negative electrode in a vacuum tube
- Investigated the composition and behavior of cathode rays, including their deflection by electric fields

 # **Photoelectric effect**
- Discovered the photoelectric effect, which is the phenomenon where light hitting a metal surface can cause electrons to be emitted
- Showed that the energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency, not the intensity, of the light
- This work laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics and the understanding of the behavior of electrons in matter

 # _Third Reich treatment_
- Hertz's scientific work was used to support Nazi ideology, particularly in the areas of eugenics and racial purity
- Some of his colleagues and students were forced to distance themselves from him due to his Jewish heritage and/or political beliefs

 # Legacy and honors
- Hertz's work on electromagnetic waves paved the way for modern communication systems, including radio, television, and wireless networks
- Honored with numerous awards and recognitions, including the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1894
- His name is commemorated in various scientific institutions and awards, such as the Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin and the Hertz Prize of the American Physical Society
