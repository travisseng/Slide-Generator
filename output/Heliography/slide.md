Heliography was invented by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in the early 19th century. He discovered that certain chemicals could be used to create images on a surface, paving the way for modern photography.

 # Camera Pictures

Niépce's first successful heliograph was created using a camera obscura, which projected an image onto a plate coated with a light-sensitive material. This allowed him to capture realistic images with unprecedented detail.

 # Precursor to the Daguerreotype

Heliography was a precursor to the daguerreotype, another early photographic process. Both methods used chemicals to create images, but the daguerreotype had several key differences in its process and results.

 # Partnership with Daguerre

Niépce partnered with Louis Daguerre, a French artist and inventor, to improve and refine the heliographic process. Together, they experimented with different chemicals and techniques to create more detailed and permanent images.

 # **Chemistry**

The heliographic process involved the use of various chemicals to create images. These included silver nitrate, lavender oil, and other substances that were applied to a surface and exposed to light. The resulting image was a negative impression of the original subject.

 # _Alternative Meanings_


The term "heliography" has been used in other contexts to refer to the study of the sun and its rays, as well as the use of heliographic methods for artistic purposes. However, the primary meaning of the term refers to the early photographic process invented by Niépce.

 # _Other Early Photographic Procedures_

In addition to heliography and daguerreotypy, there were several other early photographic procedures that were developed in the 19th century. These included cyanotype, ambrotype, and tintype, among others.

 # Other Sources

There are many other sources of information about heliography and its history. Some recommended sources include books, academic articles, and online resources such as museum websites and historical societies.

I hope this slide presentation provides a helpful overview of heliography! Is there anything else you would like to know?
