 # Lorentz and Special Relativity
- Developed the theory of special relativity, which challenged traditional notions of space and time
- Showed that time and space are relative, and can be affected by motion and gravity
- Introduced the concept of time dilation and length contraction, which have had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe
