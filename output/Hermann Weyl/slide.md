 # **Distribution of Eigenvalues**
- Weyl's work on the distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on a Riemannian manifold led to important results in the field of geometric analysis.
- The Weyl law, which states that the number of eigenvalues less than or equal to x decreases like x^2 as x increases, has far-reaching implications for the study of manifolds and their properties.

 # Geometric Foundations of Manifolds and Physics

- Weyl's work on the foundations of manifold theory and his introduction of the concept of a "geometric manifold" laid the groundwork for modern differential geometry and its applications in physics.
- His work on the curvature of manifolds and the Riemann-Roch theorem has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the geometric structure of spacetime and the behavior of physical systems.
