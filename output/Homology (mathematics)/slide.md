 # Homology (mathematics)

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Background
- Homology is a branch of algebraic topology that studies the properties of spaces using chains and boundaries.
- It was introduced by French mathematician Henri Poincaré in the late 19th century.
- Homology has since become a fundamental tool in mathematics, science, and engineering.

 # Origins
- The concept of homology can be traced back to the work of mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and Bernhard Riemann.
- However, it was not until the work of Poincaré that homology became a distinct field of study.

- One of the earliest and most famous applications of homology is in the study of surfaces.
- In the early 20th century, mathematicians such as Max Dehn and Hassler Whitney used homology to classify surfaces and study their properties.

 # Generalization

- Homology has since been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces and has become a fundamental tool in algebraic topology.
- The concept of homology is now applied to a wide range of fields, including geometry, topology, and computer science.

 # _Informal Examples_
- Homology can be intuitively understood through informal examples such as the Möbius strip and the Klein bottle.
- These examples illustrate how homology can be used to study the properties of spaces and their boundaries.

 # Construction of Homology Groups

- Homology groups are constructed using chains and boundaries.
- There are several different methods for constructing homology groups, including the singular chain complex and the Cech cohomology.

 # Homology vs. Homotopy

- Homology and homotopy are related but distinct concepts in algebraic topology.
- Homology studies the properties of spaces using chains and boundaries, while homotopy studies the topological equivalence of spaces.

 # Types of Homology

- There are several different types of homology theories, including singular homology, simplicial homology, and group homology.
- Each type of homology theory has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is best suited to different types of spaces and applications.

 # Simplicial Homology
- Simplicial homology is a type of homology theory that uses simplices (simplexes) to study the properties of spaces.
- It is particularly well-suited to studying the properties of manifolds and other smooth spaces.


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Singular Homology_
- Singular homology is a type of homology theory that uses singular chains (chains with non-integer coefficients) to study the properties of spaces.
- It is particularly well-suited to studying the properties of topological spaces with non-smooth structures, such as algebraic varieties and topological semialgebraic spaces.


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Group Homology**
- Group homology is a type of homology theory that uses groups instead of chains and boundaries to study the properties of spaces.
- It is particularly well-suited to studying the properties of spaces with a large amount of symmetry, such as orbifolds and other symmetric spaces.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Other Homology Theories
- In addition to singular homology, simplicial homology, and group homology, there are several other types of homology theories, including sheaf homology, cohomology with coefficients, and twisted homology.
- Each type of homology theory has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is best suited to different types of spaces and applications.

 # **Homology Functors**

- Homology functors are functions that map one space to another, while preserving the homology groups of the spaces.
- They are used to study the properties of spaces under different types of transformations and mappings.

 # Properties
- Homology has several important properties, including the Euler-Lefschetz theorem, the Brouwer fixed point theorem, and the Betti numbers.
- These properties are used to study the properties of spaces and their homology groups.
