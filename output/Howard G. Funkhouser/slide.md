 # Playfair and his charts
- Playfair charts are a type of bar chart that display categorical data
- Each bar represents the value of one category, and the length of the bar corresponds to the magnitude of the value
- Playfair charts are useful for comparing the relative frequencies of different categories

 # A note on a tenth century graph

- In his 1936 paper, Funkhouser noted that a similar graphical representation of statistical data had been used in a tenth century Persian manuscript
- This shows that the idea of using graphs to display statistical data has a long history and was not invented by Funkhouser or his contemporaries

 # Historical development of the graphical representation of statistical data

- Funkhouser's work built on earlier contributions to the field of statistical graphics, including the use of pie charts and bar charts
- The development of modern statistical graphics has been a collaborative effort over many centuries and continues to evolve today
