 # Introduction to the Human Eye

- The human eye is a complex and highly specialized organ that allows us to see and interpret the world around us

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Structure of the Human Eye

- The eye consists of several structures, including the cornea, pupil, lens, retina, and optic nerve
- Each structure plays a crucial role in the process of vision

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Size of the Human Eye**

- The average size of a human eye is approximately 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter
- However, the size of the eye can vary depending on several factors, such as age and genetics

 # _Components of the Human Eye_

- The components of the human eye include the cornea, pupil, lens, retina, and optic nerve
- Each component works together to facilitate the process of vision

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _Structures Surrounding the Eye_
- The eye is surrounded by several structures, including the eyebrow, eyelid, and orbit (the bony cavity that contains the eye)
- These structures help protect the eye and maintain its proper position in the socket

 # Extraocular Muscles

- The extraocular muscles are responsible for moving the eyes in different directions
- There are six extraocular muscles that control the movements of the eye

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Vision

- Vision is the process by which the eye interprets light and creates a visual representation of the world around us
- The human eye is capable of detecting light and color, as well as perceiving depth and distance

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **Field of View**
- The field of view is the range of vision that can be seen by the human eye at any given time
- The field of view is determined by the position of the eye and the movement of the head
<div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; flex-flow: row; min-height: 0"><div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; justify-content: center;min-height:0;min-width:0; margin-bottom:0.1em;;margin-right:0.15em">

 # Dynamic Range
- The dynamic range of the human eye refers to the range of light intensities that can be detected by the eye
- The dynamic range of the human eye is approximately 100,000:1, allowing us to see both bright and dim light sources

 # Rapid Eye Movements

- Rapid eye movements (REM) are the fastest type of eye movement, occurring during dreams and other mental imagery
- REM eye movements are important for cognitive function and memory consolidation

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Saccades_

- Saccades are quick, smooth eye movements that allow us to shift our gaze between different points in our field of view
- Saccades are important for reading, driving, and other everyday activities

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Fixational Eye Movements

- Fixational eye movements are slow, small eye movements that occur while we are looking at a fixed point
- Fixational eye movements help us maintain focus and track movement in our field of view

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Vestibulo-ocular Reflexes
- Vestibulo-ocular reflexes are the reflexive responses of the eye to changes in head position and movement
- These reflexes help us maintain balance and orientation in our environment


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Smooth Pursuit Movement**

- Smooth pursuit movement is a type of eye movement that allows us to track moving objects in our field of view
- This type of movement is important for activities such as playing sports or watching a video

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Optokinetic Reflex

- The optokinetic reflex is the reflexive response of the eye to changes in light intensity and color
- This reflex helps us maintain focus and perceive depth in our environment

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Near Response

- The near response is the ability of the eye to accommodate (change shape) in order to focus on close objects
- This response is important for activities such as reading or working on a computer

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Vergence Movement
<div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; flex-flow: row; min-height: 0"><div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; justify-content: center;min-height:0;min-width:0; margin-bottom:0.1em;;margin-right:0.15em">

</div>
</div>

- Vergence movement is the ability of the eye to converge (come together) or diverge (move apart) in order to maintain single vision
- This type of movement is important for activities such as reading or watching a movie

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Pupil Constriction
- Pupil constriction is the process by which the pupil (the opening in the center of the eye) becomes smaller in response to bright light
- This process helps protect the eye from damage caused by excessive light exposure


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Accommodation of the Lens
- Accommodation of the lens is the ability of the lens to change shape in order to focus on objects at different distances
- This process is important for activities such as reading or driving


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Eye Care Professionals_

- Eye care professionals, such as optometrists and ophthalmologists, are responsible for diagnosing and treating eye diseases and disorders
- These professionals use a variety of techniques and technologies to examine the eye and determine the cause of any problems or issues

 # Macular Degeneration

- Macular degeneration is a condition in which the macula (the part of the retina responsible for central vision) deteriorates over time
- This condition can cause vision loss and blindness, but there are several treatment options available
