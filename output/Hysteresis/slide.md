 # Hysteresis

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Etymology and History

- Hysteresis comes from the Greek words "hystereo" meaning "to suspend" and "is" meaning "to be"
- The concept of hysteresis has been around for centuries, dating back to the work of ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato
- In the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists such as Robert Boyle and Jacques Turgot studied the phenomenon of hysteresis in various physical systems

 # Types of Hysteresis
- Rate-dependent hysteresis: the behavior of a system depends on the rate at which it is subjected to changes in its conditions
- Rate-independent hysteresis: the behavior of a system does not depend on the rate at which it is subjected to changes in its conditions

 # In Engineering
- Control systems: hysteresis is used to model and control complex systems, such as those found in robotics and automation
- Electronic circuits: hysteresis is used to prevent overheating and damage to electronic components
