- The ISSN is unique in its ability to identify serial publications and differentiate them from one another

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Extensions_

- The ISSN can be extended with additional information, such as the volume and issue number, or the date of publication
- This allows for more specific identification and retrieval of periodicals, especially in cases where there are multiple publications with the same title

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Media versus Content

- The ISSN is a identifier for the media (print or electronic) in which the content is published
- The content itself can also be identified by other identifiers, such as the DOI or the URL

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Use in URNs
- The ISSN can be used as part of a Uniform Resource Name (URN) to identify and retrieve specific digital objects, such as electronic articles or online issues of periodicals


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Problems
- The use of the ISSN can sometimes pose challenges, such as dealing with changes in publication frequency or format
- These challenges can be addressed by using additional identifiers, such as the DOI or the URL, to provide more specific information about the publication


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Media Category Labels
