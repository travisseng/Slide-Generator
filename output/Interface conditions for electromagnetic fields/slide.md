 # Introduction
- Electromagnetic fields are ubiquitous in nature and technology
- Interface conditions are essential to understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields at boundaries between media


---

 # **Interface Conditions for Electric Field Vectors**
- At an interface between two media, the electric field vectors must be continuous across the interface
- This means that the tangent vector to the interface at a given point must be parallel to the electric field vector


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Electric Field Strength
- The electric field strength is defined as the magnitude of the electric field vector at a given point
- At an interface, the electric field strength must be continuous across the interface

 # Electric Displacement Field
- The electric displacement field is a vector field that describes the distribution of electric charge in a medium
- At an interface, the electric displacement field must be continuous across the interface

 # **Interface Conditions for Magnetic Field Vectors**
- At an interface between two media, the magnetic field vectors must be continuous across the interface
- This means that the tangent vector to the interface at a given point must be parallel to the magnetic field vector

 # Magnetic Flux Density
- The magnetic flux density is defined as the magnitude of the magnetic field vector at a given point
- At an interface, the magnetic flux density must be continuous across the interface

 # Magnetic Field Strength

- The magnetic field strength is defined as the magnitude of the magnetic field vector at a given point
- At an interface, the magnetic field strength must be continuous across the interface

 # Discussion According to the Media Beside the Interface

- If medium 1 and medium 2 are perfect dielectrics, then the electric field and magnetic field vectors are continuous across the interface
- If medium 1 is a perfect dielectric and medium 2 is a perfect metal, then the electric field vector is continuous across the interface, but the magnetic field vector is discontinuous

 # Boundary Conditions
- At an interface between two media, there are four possible boundary conditions for the electric field and magnetic field vectors:

+ Continuity of the electric field vector

+ Continuity of the magnetic field vector

+ Discontinuity of the electric field vector

+ Discontinuity of the magnetic field vector

 # Conclusion
- Interface conditions are essential for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields at boundaries between media
- The interface conditions for electric and magnetic fields are related to the continuity of the field vectors across the interface
- Boundary conditions are used to specify the behavior of the field vectors at the interface.
