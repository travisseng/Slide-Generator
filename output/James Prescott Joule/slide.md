 # _The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat_
- Joule's most famous experiment: measuring the heat generated by a falling weight
- Determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, which is now known as the "Joule"
- Published his findings in a paper titled "On the Dynamics of Heat" in 1843

 # Kinetic Theory
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Joule's work was based on the kinetic theory of gases, which states that the motion of particles in a fluid is responsible for its properties and behavior
- He used this theory to explain the conversion of mechanical energy into heat energy
