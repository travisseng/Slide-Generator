- Biot was one of the first scientists to study electromagnetism
- He discovered that electric and magnetic fields are two sides of the same coin, and can be transformed into each other
- His work in this field laid the foundation for modern electromagnetic theory

 # Meteorites
- Biot was fascinated by meteorites and their origins
- He studied the composition and properties of meteorites, and proposed that they were fragments of a larger body that had fallen to Earth
- His work in this field helped establish the study of meteorites as a legitimate scientific pursuit

 # Polarized light

- Biot made significant contributions to the study of polarized light
- He discovered that light can be polarized, or oriented in a specific direction
- His work in this field led to the development of polarizing filters and other optical devices

 # Cream of Tartar

- Biot was interested in the properties of cream of tartar, a substance commonly used in cooking and medicine
- He discovered that cream of tartar has the ability to rotate the plane of polarization of light
- This discovery led to the development of new optical devices and techniques
