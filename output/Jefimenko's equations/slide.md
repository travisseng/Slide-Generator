 # Jefimenko's equations

 # Equations
- Jefimenko's equations are a set of four equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in space and time.
- These equations are based on the idea that the electric and magnetic fields can be represented as retarded potentials, which are functions of the position and time.

- The electric field (E) is a vector field that describes the strength and direction of the electric force at each point in space and time.
- The magnetic field (B) is a vector field that describes the strength and direction of the magnetic force at each point in space and time.

 # Origin from Retarded Potentials
- Jefimenko's equations are derived from the idea that the electric and magnetic fields can be represented as retarded potentials, which are functions of the position and time.
- The retarded potentials are a way of describing the effects of the electric charge on the electromagnetic field, even if the charge is not at its current location.

- The Heaviside–Feynman formula is a simplification of Jefimenko's equations that is often used to solve problems involving electromagnetic fields.
- This formula is based on the idea that the electric and magnetic fields can be represented as simple functions of the position and time, rather than as more complex retarded potentials.

 # **Notes**

- Jefimenko's equations are named after the physicist George Jefimenko, who first developed them in the early 20th century.
- These equations are an extension of Maxwell's equations, which describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields in a more limited way.
- Jefimenko's equations have been used to solve many problems in physics and engineering, including the study of electromagnetic waves and the design of electromagnetic devices.
