 # _Later Career in Academia_

- Professor at the University of Texas at Austin (1945-1968)
- Director of the Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of Texas at Austin (1960-1968)
- Developed the theory of "geometrodynamics" which attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Geometrodynamics

- Attempted to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity through the concept of "geometrodynamics"
- Developed a new approach to quantum field theory based on the idea of "spacetime" as a dynamic, curved entity

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **General Relativity**

- Influenced by the work of Albert Einstein and his theory of general relativity
- Attempted to extend the principles of general relativity to quantum mechanics
- Developed new theories and models of black holes and other cosmic phenomena based on general relativity

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _Participatory Anthropic Principle_
- Proposed the "participatory anthropic principle" which suggests that consciousness plays a fundamental role in the universe
- Argued that the existence of conscious beings is necessary for the development of the universe as we know it
- Contributed to the ongoing debates surrounding the nature of consciousness and the role of human beings in the universe

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Opposition to Parapsychology
- Criticized parapsychology and other fringe scientific fields for their lack of empirical evidence and rigorous methodology
- Argued that such fields are not grounded in the principles of physics and are therefore not scientifically valid
