 # Biography

- Poynting studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics and later his doctorate in physics.
- He served as a lecturer at Trinity College before becoming a fellow of the Royal Society in 1894.
- Poynting was known for his work on electromagnetic theory, particularly his development of the Poynting vector, which is used to describe the direction and magnitude of electromagnetic waves.

- "On the Dynamical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism" (1895) - This book is considered one of the most important works on electromagnetic theory in the late 19th century.
- "The Electrical Nature of Light" (1903) - In this work, Poynting presented a new theory of light that described it as an electromagnetic wave.
- "The Propagation of Electric Waves through Space" (1904) - This paper introduced the concept of the Poynting vector and described how electric waves propagate through space.
