 # **Physics of Photography**
- Schwarzschild's early work focused on the physics of photography, particularly the study of light and its interactions with matter
- Developed a theory of light absorption and reflection that explained the behavior of light in different materials
- Applied his knowledge of electromagnetism to improve the quality of photographs

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Electrodynamics
- Made significant contributions to the field of electrodynamics, including work on Maxwell's equations and the behavior of electric and magnetic fields
- Developed a new approach to understanding the nature of electric and magnetic fields, which was later recognized as a fundamental breakthrough in the field
