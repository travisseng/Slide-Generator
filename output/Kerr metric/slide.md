 # Kerr metric

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Overview**

- The Kerr metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the spacetime geometry of a rotating black hole.
- It was discovered by Roy Kerr in 1963 and has since become one of the most well-known and important solutions in general relativity.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Metric
- The Kerr metric is given by the line element:

ds^2 = -dt^2 + (2Mr)^2 / (r^2 \* sin^2\theta) dphi^2 - dr^2 / (r^2 \* sin^2\theta) - dtheta^2

where M is the mass of the black hole, J is its angular momentum, r is the radial distance from the center of the black hole, and \theta is the polar angle.

 # **Boyer–Lindquist Coordinates**

- The Boyer–Lindquist coordinates are a set of coordinates that are well-suited for studying the Kerr metric.
- In these coordinates, the event horizon of the black hole is located at r = 2M and the ergosphere is located at r = M + \sqrt{J^2 - M^2}.

 # Kerr–Schild Coordinates

- The Kerr–Schild coordinates are another set of coordinates that are useful for studying the Kerr metric.
- In these coordinates, the event horizon and ergosphere are located at r = 0 and r = M + \sqrt{J^2 - M^2}, respectively.

 # _Soliton Coordinates_
- The soliton coordinates are a set of coordinates that were introduced by Bondi et al. in 1964.
- In these coordinates, the Kerr metric takes on a simple form and can be used to study the properties of black holes in a more straightforward way.

 # _Mass of Rotational Energy_

- The mass of rotational energy is given by the formula:

M = (1/2) \* J^2 / (r^2 \* sin^2\theta)

This formula can be used to calculate the mass of a black hole based on its angular momentum and distance from the center of the black hole.

 # Wave Operator
- The wave operator is a mathematical object that describes the behavior of waves in the Kerr spacetime.
- It was introduced by Frolov and Page in 1998 and has since been used to study various properties of black holes.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Frame Dragging_

- Frame dragging is a phenomenon that occurs in rotating black holes, where the rotation of the black hole causes the spacetime around it to rotate along with it.
- This effect was first proposed by Penrose in 1965 and has since been observed in numerical simulations of black hole spacetimes.
