 # _Introduction_

- The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a joint project of MIT and Caltech
- LIGO detects gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime produced by violent cosmic events, such as black hole mergers
- The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) is a partnership of scientists and engineers from multiple institutions working together to analyze data from LIGO

 # History
- LIGO was founded in 1984 by MIT and Caltech
- The first LIGO detector was built in Hanford, WA and was operated from 2002-2010
- The second LIGO detector was built in Livingston, LA and was operational from 2015-present
- The LSC was formed in 2003 to coordinate the analysis of LIGO data
