 # Introduction

- LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is a groundbreaking scientific facility designed to detect and study gravitational waves
- Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime produced by violent cosmic events, such as black hole mergers and supernovae explosions

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # History
- LIGO was founded in 1984 as a collaboration between Caltech and MIT
- The project underwent significant advancements in the 1990s, including the development of critical technologies such as high-power lasers and precision interferometry
- LIGO's first observatory was constructed in Hanford, Washington, and the second in Livingston, Louisiana

 # Background
- Gravitational waves were predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but their detection had proven elusive until the development of LIGO's advanced technology
- LIGO uses laser interferometry to detect tiny distortions in spacetime caused by gravitational waves
- The observatory consists of two identical detectors, one in Hanford and one in Livingston, each with a 4-kilometer-long arm

 # **Observations Begin**
- LIGO's first observations began in 2015, using its initial detector called G1
- The observatory was initially designed to detect gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers
- In its first observing run, LIGO detected no events, but the data collected during this time helped improve the detector's sensitivity

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **Detections**
- On September 14, 2015, LIGO made history by detecting its first gravitational wave event from the merger of two binary black holes
- The detected waveform matched the predicted waveform for a binary black hole merger, providing strong evidence for the validity of general relativity
- Since then, LIGO has made several more detections, including the merger of two binary neutron stars in 2017

 # _Mission_
- LIGO's primary mission is to detect and study gravitational waves from cosmic sources
- The observatory's secondary mission includes testing the fundamental laws of physics and pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the universe
- LIGO has already led to significant advancements in astrophysics, including the detection of binary black hole mergers and the measurement of their masses and spins

 # Observatories
- LIGO has two identical observatories, one in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana
- Each observatory consists of two 4-kilometer-long arms, oriented at right angles to each other, which are used to detect gravitational waves
- The observatories are designed to be extremely sensitive, with arm lengths that must be stabilized to within a few nanometers

- LIGO operates by sending a laser beam down each of its two arms, then reflecting it back and measuring the minute distortions caused by gravitational waves
- The detectors are so sensitive that they can detect changes in the position of the mirrors within a few nanometers, allowing for the precise measurement of gravitational waves
- LIGO's operation is highly advanced and requires constant monitoring and control to ensure optimal performance
