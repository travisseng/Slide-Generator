 # **Lemaître–Tolman metric**

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction
- The Lemaître-Tolman metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the evolution of a dust-filled universe.
- It was developed independently by both Hubert Lemaître and Richard Tolman in the 1930s.

 # Details
- The Lemaître-Tolman metric is given by the line element:

ds^2 = (1 + 2V(t)) dt^2 - (1 - 2V(t)) dr^2 - r^2 dΩ^2

where V(t) is the cosmological redshift, and dΩ^2 is the solid angle element.

 # **Schwarzschild Solution**
- The Lemaître-Tolman metric can be simplified to the Schwarzschild solution in the limit where the matter density is zero.
- The Schwarzschild solution describes a static, spherically symmetric universe with a radius of curvature given by:

R = 2GM/c^2

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the universe, and c is the speed of light.

 # Gravitational Collapse
- The Lemaître-Tolman metric can also be used to study the gravitational collapse of a dust-filled universe.
- In this case, the redshift function V(t) describes the collapse of the universe, and the scale factor a(t) is related to the distance to the observer.

 # **Observational Consequences**

- The Lemaître-Tolman metric has several observational consequences that can be tested against observations.
- For example, the metric predicts that the universe should be expanding at a rate that is proportional to the distance to the observer.

 # Comparison with Observations
- The Lemaître-Tolman metric has been compared to several observational datasets, including the cosmic microwave background radiation and the distances to type Ia supernovae.
- These comparisons have shown good agreement between the predictions of the metric and the observations.
