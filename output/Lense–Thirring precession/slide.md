 # Lenseâ€“Thirring precession

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction
- Lense-Thirring precession is a phenomenon in which the rotation of a massive, rotating body causes the nearby space to rotate along with it
- This effect was first predicted by physicists Hendrik Lense and Wilhelm Thirring in 1918

 # The Lense-Thirring Metric

- The Lense-Thirring metric is a mathematical description of the gravitational field of a rotating body
- It includes both the familiar Newtonian potential and a new, rotational term that arises from the body's rotation

 # **The Coriolis Term**
- The Coriolis term is a crucial aspect of the Lense-Thirring metric, as it describes the effect of the body's rotation on the surrounding space
- It is responsible for the observed precession of the rotating body's equatorial plane

 # Precession
- Precession is the slow, wobbling motion of a rotating body's equatorial plane due to the Coriolis term in the Lense-Thirring metric
- This motion is similar to the precession of a spinning top, but on a much larger scale and with a much longer period

 # Gravitomagnetic Analysis
- The gravitomagnetic effect is a fundamental aspect of general relativity that describes the gravitational field of a rotating body as a "magnetic" field
- This analysis provides a powerful tool for understanding the Lense-Thirring precession and its astrophysical implications

 # Example: Foucault's Pendulum
- One of the most famous examples of Lense-Thirring precession is Foucault's pendulum, which was first observed in the late 19th century by French physicist Leon Foucault
- The pendulum's plane of oscillation slowly precesses over time due to the Coriolis term in the Lense-Thirring metric

 # Experimental Verification

- Lense-Thirring precession has been experimentally verified in numerous studies, including observations of the Earth's rotation and measurements of the gravitational field of rotating celestial bodies such as stars and black holes
- These experiments have confirmed the predictions of general relativity to a high degree of accuracy

 # _Astrophysical Setting_

- Lense-Thirring precession has important implications for astrophysical phenomena such as the behavior of matter in strong gravitational fields and the evolution of rotating celestial bodies over time
- It provides a new, powerful tool for understanding these phenomena and making precise predictions about them

 # Astrophysical Tests

- The Lense-Thirring precession has been tested in a variety of astrophysical contexts, including the study of binary star systems and the behavior of matter in the vicinity of black holes
- These tests have provided valuable insights into the nature of gravity and the behavior of rotating celestial bodies
