 # Lenz's law

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction
- Lenz's Law states that the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it produces opposes the change in the original magnetic field.
- This law was discovered by German physicist Heinrich Lenz in 1832.

 # Definition
- Lenz's Law states that the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it produces opposes the change in the original magnetic field.
- The law is based on the idea that the interaction between magnetic fields and moving charges (such as electrons) is such that the charged particles will experience a force in a direction that opposes the change in the magnetic field.

 # Example

- Consider a simple example of a coil of wire being moved towards a permanent magnet. As the coil approaches the magnet, the magnetic field of the magnet induces an electric current in the coil.
- According to Lenz's Law, the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it produces opposes the change in the original magnetic field (i.e. the movement of the coil towards the magnet).

 # _Detailed interaction of charges in these currents_

- To understand how Lenz's Law works, let's consider the detailed interaction of charges in the currents induced by a changing magnetic field.
- When a charge is moved through a magnetic field, it experiences a force that is perpendicular to both the direction of motion and the magnetic field.
- According to Lenz's Law, the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it produces opposes the change in the original magnetic field. This means that the force experienced by the charged particles (such as electrons) is in a direction that opposes the change in the magnetic field.

 # Conservation of momentum
- Lenz's Law can also be understood in terms of conservation of momentum. When a charge is moved through a magnetic field, it gains momentum due to the force experienced by the charged particle.
- According to Lenz's Law, the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it produces opposes the change in the original magnetic field. This means that the momentum gained by the charged particles (such as electrons) is conserved, and cannot be changed.

 # _Conclusion_

- Lenz's Law is an important principle in physics that describes how moving charges interact with magnetic fields.
- The law states that the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it produces opposes the change in the original magnetic field.
- Understanding Lenz's Law can help us better understand a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of electrical currents to the operation of motors and generators.
