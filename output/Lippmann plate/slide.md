 # _Method_

- Description of the method used to create Lippmann plates, including the process of glass blowing and the application of a specialized coating.

Lippmann plates are created by blowing glass into a mold to form a convex lens. The surface of the plate is then coated with a thin layer of silver or gold to enhance its reflective properties. This process allows for the creation of high-quality plates that can be used in a variety of microscopy techniques.

 # **Advantages of Lippmann Plates**

- Discussion of the advantages of using Lippmann plates in microscopy, including their high numerical aperture and resolution, and their ability to image deep into samples.

Lippmann plates offer several advantages over traditional microscope slides. They have a higher numerical aperture, which allows for higher resolution imaging of samples. Additionally, the convex shape of the plate allows for deeper imaging into samples without the need for specialized objectives. This makes Lippmann plates ideal for imaging thick samples or samples with complex structures.
