 # Definition of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials
- The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are a set of four potentials that describe the electric and magnetic fields of a charged particle in motion
- They are defined as the solution to Maxwell's equations with the source term being the Lorentz force on the charged particle

 # Field Computation
- The Liénard-Wiechert potentials can be computed using the retarded time, which is the time at which the field is evaluated
- The retarded time is related to the position of the charged particle and the observer's frame of reference

 # Universal Speed Limit

- The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related to the concept of the universal speed limit, which is a fundamental property of the universe
- The universal speed limit states that no object can move faster than the speed of light, and this property is reflected in the behavior of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials
