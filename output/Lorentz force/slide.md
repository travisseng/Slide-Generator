 # _Introduction_

- The Lorentz force is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the force experienced by a charged particle in an electromagnetic field.
- The Lorentz force law is a definition of the electric and magnetic fields (E and B).

 # Lorentz Force Law

- The Lorentz force law states that the force on a charged particle is equal to the magnitude of the charge times the vector sum of the electric and magnetic forces.
- Mathematically, this can be written as F = q(E + v x B), where F is the force, q is the charge, E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, and v is the velocity of the charged particle.

 # Equation
- The Lorentz force equation can be written in a more compact form as F = q(E x B), where E x B is the dot product of the electric and magnetic fields.
