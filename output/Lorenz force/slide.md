 # Lorenz force

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Introduction**
- The Lorentz force is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the force experienced by a charged particle in an electromagnetic field.
- The force is named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, who first described it in the late 19th century.

 # Lorentz Force Law as the Definition of E and B

- The Lorentz force law states that the force on a charged particle is equal to the cross product of the particle's velocity and the electromagnetic field.
- Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

F = q(E + v x B)

where F is the force, q is the charge of the particle, E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, and v is the velocity of the particle.

 # Equation
- The equation for the Lorentz force can be written in different forms depending on the context.
- Here are a few examples:

F = q(E + v x B) (in cartesian coordinates)

F = q(E x v + B x v) (in component form)

F = q(E x B) (in vector form)

- The Lorentz force only applies to charged particles, such as electrons or protons.
- Neutral particles, such as neutrons or photons, do not experience the Lorentz force.

<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- The Lorentz force can also be applied to distributed charges, such as a wire carrying an electric current.
- In this case, the force is proportional to the amount of charge and the velocity of the charged particles.

 # Equation in cgs Units
- The equation for the Lorentz force can be written in cgs units (centimeters, grams, seconds) as:

F = q(E + v x B) × (4.135 x 10^-7 N/C) × (2.998 x 10^8 m/s)

where the constant factor is the conversion from SI to cgs units.
