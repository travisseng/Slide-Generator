 # Description
- Lorenz gauge is a mathematical framework used to study nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and their solutions.
- It was introduced by the mathematician Edward Lorenz in the 1960s as a way to study chaotic systems.

 # History
- Lorenz gauge was developed by Edward Lorenz in the 1960s as part of his work on chaos theory.
- The gauge was originally used to study the solution of a specific PDE called the Lorenz equation, which models certain types of fluid dynamics.
- Since then, the gauge has been applied to a wide range of fields, including physics, engineering, and finance.
