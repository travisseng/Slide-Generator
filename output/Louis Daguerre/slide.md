- Daguerre's early experiments with photography were influenced by his work as a theatrical set designer
- He discovered that exposing silver-coated copper plates to iodine vapor and then exposing them to light produced an image
- He refined the process and introduced it to the public in 1839

 # Competition with Talbot
- William Henry Fox Talbot also developed a photography process around the same time as Daguerre
- The two men were in competition with each other, but their processes were different (Talbot used paper coated with silver chloride, while Daguerre used copper plates)
- Daguerre's process became more popular due to its ease of use and the high quality of the images it produced

 # _Diorama theatres_
- Daguerre was also known for his work in creating diorama theatres, which were three-dimensional models of scenes that could be viewed through a peephole
- These theatres were popular in the 1820s and 30s and featured scenes such as battles, landscapes, and cityscapes
