 # Definition


Magnetization is the alignment of magnetic dipoles in a material. It is a measure of the strength and direction of the magnetic field within the material.

 # _In Maxwell's Equations_

Magnetization is described by Maxwell's equations, which describe how electric and magnetic fields interact with matter. The equations are:

∇ • B = 0 (Gauss's law for magnetic fields)

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law of induction)

∇ × B = J + με (Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction)

 # Relations between B, H, and M


There are several important relations between the magnetic field B, the magnetic flux density H, and the magnetization M:

H = B/μ (where μ is the magnetic permeability)

M = B/A (where A is the area of the material)

 # Magnetization Current

The magnetization current is the flow of electrons within a material that is responsible for maintaining the magnetic field. It is an important concept in magnetostatics.
