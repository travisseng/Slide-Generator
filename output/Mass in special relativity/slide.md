 # **Mass in special relativity**

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Introduction
- Subtitle: A Journey Through the Fundamentals of the Theory


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Rest Mass

- Definition: The mass of an object when it is at rest
- Example: A tennis ball has a rest mass of approximately 0.05 kg

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Relativistic Mass

- Summary of key points about relativistic mass
- Discussion of how the concept of relativistic mass is a fundamental aspect of special relativity

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Relativistic vs. Rest Mass

- Comparison of the relativistic and rest masses of an object
- Discussion of how the relativistic mass depends on the object's velocity

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Invariant Mass

- Definition: The mass of an object that remains constant regardless of the observer's frame of reference
- Example: The invariant mass of a photon is zero, as it has no rest mass and does not gain or lose mass in motion

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Relativistic Energy-Momentum Equation

- Formulation of the equation that relates an object's energy and momentum to its relativistic mass
- Discussion of how this equation differs from classical mechanics

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **The Mass of Composite Systems**

- Explanation of how the mass of a composite system is calculated using the masses of its individual parts
- Example: The mass of a car with two passengers is greater than the sum of the rest masses of the car and the passengers due to their combined kinetic energy

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Conservation vs. Invariance of Mass in Special Relativity
- Discussion of how the concept of mass is not conserved in special relativity, but rather it is an invariant property of the universe
- Example: The total mass of a closed system can change due to energy and momentum transfer, but the individual rest masses of its parts remain constant


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Closed Systems
- Explanation of what constitutes a closed system in special relativity
- Discussion of how the concept of mass is applied to closed systems


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # System Invariant Mass vs. Individual Rest Masses

- Comparison of the system invariant mass and the individual rest masses of parts of the system
- Discussion of how these two concepts are related but distinct

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _History of the Relativistic Mass Concept_

 # Transverse and Longitudinal Mass

- Explanation of how the concept of transverse and longitudinal mass differs from traditional notions of mass
- Discussion of how these concepts are related to the polarization of objects in motion

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Popular Science and Textbooks_
