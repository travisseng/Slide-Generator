 # _Maxwell relations_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Introduction**
- Maxwell's relations are a set of equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in space and time
- These relations are fundamental to our understanding of electromagnetic phenomena, and have numerous applications in physics, engineering, and technology

 # Equations

- The four most common Maxwell relations are:

1. Gauss's law for electric fields (in Cartesian coordinates): ∇⋅E = ρ/ε0

2. Gauss's law for magnetic fields (in Cartesian coordinates): ∇⋅B = 0

3. Faraday's law of induction (in Cartesian coordinates): ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

4. Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction (in Cartesian coordinates): ∇×B = μ0J + μ0ε0 ∂E/∂t

 # Derivation of the Equations
- The Maxwell relations can be derived using the technique of multipolar expansion, which involves expressing the electric and magnetic fields in terms of their scalar and vector potentials
- The equations can also be derived using the method of partial differential equations, which involves applying the principles of physics to find the solutions to the equations

 # **Derivation Based on Jacobians**
- Another way to derive the Maxwell relations is by using the concept of Jacobians, which are matrices that describe the change of basis between two sets of vectors
- By using Jacobians, we can express the electric and magnetic fields in terms of their scalar and vector potentials, and find the equations that govern their behavior

 # General Maxwell Relationships
- In addition to the four most common Maxwell relations, there are many other relationships that are derived from the same set of principles
- These include the wave equation for electromagnetic waves, the Lorentz force law for charged particles, and the Maxwell-Hertz wave equation for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a medium
