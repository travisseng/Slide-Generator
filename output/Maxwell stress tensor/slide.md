 # Equation

- The Maxwell stress tensor is defined as:

σ = (1/2) (∇ x E + ∇ x B)

where σ is the stress tensor, E is the electric field, and B is the magnetic field.
- This equation expresses the fact that the stress in a material medium is influenced by both the electric and magnetic fields acting on it.
