 # **Origins**

- The term "microcomputer" was first used in the early 1970s to describe small, single-board computers that could be built and used by hobbyists and professionals alike.
- These early microcomputers were often based on integrated circuits (ICs) and were much smaller and more affordable than mainframe computers.

 # _Colloquial Use of the Term_
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Today, the term "microcomputer" is often used informally to refer to any small computer or device that is capable of performing complex tasks.
- This includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other portable devices that are equipped with powerful processors and a range of software applications.

 # **Description**

- A microcomputer is a small computer or device that is designed to perform specific tasks or functions.
- These devices typically have a limited amount of memory and processing power compared to larger computers, but they are often much more portable and affordable.

 # History
- The first microcomputers were developed in the early 1970s as kits that hobbyists could assemble and program themselves.
- These early machines were often based on TTL (transistor-transistor logic) circuits and used simple programming languages like BASIC or FORTRAN.
- In the 1980s, microcomputers became more powerful and widely available, with the introduction of the IBM PC and other popular home computers.

 # TTL Precursors

- The development of TTL (transistor-transistor logic) circuits in the 1960s paved the way for the creation of microcomputers.
- TTL circuits were smaller, faster, and more reliable than previous electronic components, making it possible to build compact computers that could be used by hobbyists and professionals alike.

- The first microcomputers were often based on single-board computers like the Altair 8800 or the Apple I.
- These machines were simple, but they allowed users to program them in BASIC or other simple languages, opening up new possibilities for hobbyists and professionals alike.

 # Home Computers

- In the 1980s, home computers like the Commodore 64 and the Apple II became popular among consumers.
- These machines were often marketed as "personal computers" and were designed to be used in the home for tasks like word processing, gaming, and communication.
