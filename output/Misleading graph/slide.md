 # Introduction

- Brief overview of the importance of graph literacy
- Purpose of the presentation: to identify and avoid misleading graphs

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.76em}</style>

 # Misleading Graph Methods

- Examples of manipulated data, such as:

+ Cherry-picking data points

+ Hiding data points

+ Distorting scales

+ Using irrelevant scales

+ Flipping axes

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # _Excessive Usage_
- How excessive usage of graphics can be misleading, such as:

+ Overwhelming the viewer with too much information

+ Drowning important information in a sea of data

+ Using too many different types of graphics


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Biased Labeling
- How biased labeling can be misleading, such as:

+ Using loaded language or emotive appeals

+ Misrepresenting the significance of data points

+ Failing to provide context for labels


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # **Fabricated Trends**

- How fabricated trends can be misleading, such as:

+ Creating artificial patterns or trends

+ Exaggerating or inventing changes in data

+ Using selective time frames to create a false narrative

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Pie Charts
- The limitations of pie charts and how they can be misleading, such as:

+ Ignoring zero or small values

+ Comparing different categories using incompatible scales

+ Hiding data points within the chart


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.80em}</style>

 # Comparing Pie Charts
<div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; flex-flow: row; min-height: 0"><div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; justify-content: center;min-height:0;min-width:0; margin-bottom:0.1em;;margin-right:0.15em">
<img style='object-fit: contain; max-height:100%; max-width:100%; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Piecharts.svg/484px-Piecharts.svg.png'/>
</div>
</div>

- How to compare pie charts effectively, such as:

+ Using direct comparisons

+ Normalizing the data to a common scale

+ Avoiding overlapping slices

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # 3D Pie Chart Slice Perspective
- The potential for misleading perspective in 3D pie charts, such as:

+ Exaggerating the importance of certain categories

+ Hiding data points behind other slices

+ Using artificial depth to create a false sense of scale


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Improper Scaling
- The dangers of improper scaling in graphics, such as:

+ Using irrelevant scales or ranges

+ Compressing or expanding data to fit a desired narrative

+ Failing to provide context for the scale


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # _Logarithmic Scaling_

- The benefits and limitations of logarithmic scaling in graphics, such as:

+ Allowing for more precise representation of data

+ Hiding important information by compressing it into a small range

+ Failing to provide context for the scale

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # **Truncated Graphs**

- The potential for misleading information in truncated graphs, such as:

+ Ignoring important information by cutting it off

+ Creating a false narrative by selectively showing only part of the data

+ Failing to provide context for the missing data

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # **Axis Changes**
- How changes in the axis can be misleading, such as:

+ Switching between linear and logarithmic scales

+ Hiding or exaggerating data points by changing the scale

+ Using irrelevant or unlabeled axes


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _No Scale_

- The importance of providing a scale for graphics, such as:

+ Allowing the viewer to understand the magnitude of the data

+ Failing to provide a scale can lead to misinterpretation or exaggeration of the data

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Improper Intervals or Units

- The importance of using appropriate intervals or units in graphics, such as:

+ Using intervals or units that are not appropriate for the data can lead to misinterpretation

+ Failing to provide context for the intervals or units can be misleading

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Omitting Data

- The potential for misleading information when data is omitted from a graph, such as:

+ Hiding important information by leaving it out of the graph

+ Creating a false narrative by selectively omitting data points

+ Failing to provide context for the missing data

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # _Academic and Corporate Use_
- How misleading graphs are used in academia and corporate reports, such as:

+ Using manipulated or biased graphics to support a desired conclusion

+ Ignoring important information or hiding it behind unnecessary complexity

+ Using overly complex graphics to intimidate or confuse the viewer


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Poor Construction

- How poor construction of graphics can lead to misleading information, such as:

+ Using unreadable or confusing visual elements

+ Failing to provide context for the data

+ Using inappropriate colors or symbols

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Extrapolation

- The dangers of extrapolating beyond the data, such as:

+ Creating false trends or patterns

+ Misrepresenting the significance of the data

+ Failing to provide context for the limitations of the data

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Measuring Distortion
- How to measure distortion in graphs, such as:

+ Using statistical measures like mean absolute error or root mean squared error

+ Using visual measures like the lie factor or graph discrepancy index


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Conclusion_
- Recap of the importance of graph literacy and avoiding misleading graphs
- Encouragement to critically evaluate all graphics for potential manipulation or misinformation.
