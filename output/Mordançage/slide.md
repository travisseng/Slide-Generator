 # Introduction

- Mordançage is a historical photographic process that produces a unique, soft focus effect
- Also known as "molding" or "vignetting," it was popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

 # _History_
- Invented by French photographer Leon Gimpel in the 1880s
- Initially used for portraiture, but later adopted for landscape and still life photography as well
- Mordançage was particularly popular in France and Belgium, but was also practiced in other parts of Europe and North America

 # Chemistry
- Mordançage involves the use of a potassium bichromate solution to sensitize the photographic paper
- The solution contains silver chloride, which becomes light-sensitive when exposed to light
- The process is similar to other silver-based photographic processes, such as gelatin dry plates and printing-out paper

 # Process
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- To create a mordançage print, the photographer would first expose the paper to light using a camera or other device
- After development, the paper would be treated with a solution of potassium bichromate and silver chloride
- The resulting image would have a soft focus effect, due to the uneven distribution of silver halides on the paper's surface

 # Preservation

- Mordançage prints are relatively rare and can be valuable to collectors and historians
- To preserve these prints, it is important to store them in a cool, dry place and avoid exposure to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures
- In some cases, mordançage prints may be treated with specialized conservation materials or techniques to prevent deterioration or damage

 # Conclusion
- Mordançage is a unique and historically significant photographic process that produces beautiful, soft focus images
- By understanding the history, chemistry, process, and preservation of mordançage, we can better appreciate and care for these rare and valuable photographs.
