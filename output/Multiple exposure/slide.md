 # Overview

- Multiple exposure is a technique where a single frame of film or digital sensor is exposed multiple times to create a unique image.
- This technique has been used in various forms of photography, including fine art, documentary, and experimental work.

 # Historical Multiple Exposure Photography
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- The concept of multiple exposure can be traced back to the early days of photography, where photographers would use special cameras or techniques to create multiple images on a single plate.
- One famous example is the "ghost" images that were sometimes created accidentally through double exposure.

 # Multiple Exposure Techniques

- There are several techniques used in multiple exposure photography, including:

+ Double exposure: where two separate images are exposed on a single frame.

+ Triple exposure: where three separate images are exposed on a single frame.

+ Multi-frame exposure: where multiple frames are exposed in a single shot.

 # Analogue Multiple Exposure
- In analogue photography, multiple exposure can be achieved through various techniques such as:

+ Using a special camera with a feature called "multiple exposure" or "double exposure".

+ Using a film camera with a feature called "bulk load" or "rewind" to expose the film multiple times.

+ Using a darkroom technique called "contact printing" to create multiple images on a single negative.

 # Digital Multiple Exposure
- In digital photography, multiple exposure can be achieved through software such as Adobe Photoshop or specialized apps like Multiple Exposure FX.
- These software allow photographers to combine multiple images into a single frame, creating unique and creative effects.

 # Adoption in Fine Art

- Many fine art photographers have adopted multiple exposure as a way to create unique and thought-provoking images.
- The technique allows for experimentation with layering, texture, and composition, resulting in visually striking works of art.

 # Long Exposures
- Long exposures are often used in multiple exposure photography to capture moving subjects or to create a sense of time passing.
- The longer exposure times allow for more opportunities to capture different images, resulting in complex and dynamic compositions.

 # Scanning Film with Multiple Exposure

- When working with film, it's important to properly scan the exposed frames to ensure the best possible results.
- Specialized scanners and software can help photographers to achieve high-quality scans, even when using multiple exposure techniques.
