 # _New SI_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Background
- The International System of Units (SI) is a standardized system of units used in scientific and technical fields
- The SI was established in 1960 to provide a consistent and coherent system of units for international use


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Development of SI_

- The SI was developed by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (ICWM)
- The SI is based on seven base units: meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Impetus for change
- The need for a more consistent and coherent system of units led to the development of the New SI
- The New SI is based on the same seven base units as the original SI, but with some changes and refinements

 # Redefinition
- The New SI redefines the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela in terms of fundamental physical constants
- The meter is now defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second

 # Impact on base unit definitions

- The New SI has a major impact on the definitions of the base units, making them more consistent and coherent with each other

 # Second
- The second is defined as the time taken by light to travel a distance of 299,792,458 meters in a vacuum
- The second is now based on the fundamental physical constant of the speed of light, rather than on an artifact such as the caesium atom

 # _Concerns_
- Some scientists have expressed concerns that the New SI may not be well-suited for certain applications, such as precision measurements or high-energy physics
- The adoption of the New SI may require significant changes to existing measurement standards and practices, which could be challenging and time-consuming

 # **Explicit-unit and explicit-constant definitions**
- The New SI includes explicit definitions for both units and constants, which ensures that the measurements are well-defined and consistent
- The use of explicit definitions helps to avoid any ambiguity or confusion in the interpretation of the measurements
