 # _Introduction to Nonlinear Optics_
- Nonlinear optics is the study of the interaction between light and matter in nonlinear media
- Nonlinear media have optical properties that change with intensity or power density

 # History of Nonlinear Optics
- Discovery of second-harmonic generation (SHG) by H. Jeffrey in 1961
- Development of nonlinear optics as a field since the 1960s

 # Nonlinear Optical Processes
- Second-harmonic generation (SHG): conversion of input laser frequency to two lower frequencies
- Sum-frequency generation (SFG): conversion of two input laser frequencies to one higher frequency
- Four-wave mixing (FWM): interaction of three or more waves in a nonlinear medium

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Frequency-Mixing Processes

- Frequency-mixing processes involve the interaction of two or more laser beams with different frequencies
- SHG, SFG, and FWM are all frequency-mixing processes

 # _Other Nonlinear Processes_
- Self-phase modulation (SPM): modification of a laser beam's phase by its own intensity
- Cross-phase modulation (XPM): modification of two laser beams' phases by each other's intensity
- Optical rectification: conversion of linear polarization to circular polarization and vice versa

- Phase matching is the condition for efficient energy transfer between frequencies in nonlinear optics
- It requires that the phases of the interacting waves be matched

 # **Higher-Order Frequency Mixing**
- Higher-order frequency mixing involves the interaction of three or more laser beams with different frequencies
- This can lead to the generation of new frequencies that are not present in the input beams

 # Frequency Doubling

- Frequency doubling involves converting a laser beam's frequency to twice its original value
- This is used in many applications, such as spectroscopy and microscopy

 # Optical Phase Conjugation
- Optical phase conjugation involves reversing the phase of a laser beam while preserving its amplitude
- This can be used to compensate for wavefront distortions or to generate a wave that propagates in the opposite direction
