 # **Overview**
- Numerical Relativity (NR) is a field of study that uses numerical methods to solve Einstein's equations of general relativity
- Goal: to simulate the behavior of black holes, neutron stars, and other astrophysical objects

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _History_
- Early efforts to numerically solve Einstein's equations date back to the 1950s and 60s
- However, these early simulations were limited by the available computing power and numerical methods
- In the 1980s and 90s, advances in computational power and numerical techniques led to a resurgence of interest in NR

 # Foundations in Theory

- Einstein's equations of general relativity provide the foundation for NR
- The equations describe how matter and energy interact with spacetime, leading to phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves
- Understanding the underlying physics is essential for developing accurate numerical methods

 # Early Results
- Early simulations focused on simple scenarios, such as collapse of a star to form a black hole
- These simulations demonstrated the ability to numerically solve Einstein's equations, but were limited in their complexity and realism

 # **Maturation of the Field**
- In the late 1990s and early 2000s, NR underwent a period of rapid maturation
- Advances in numerical methods and computational power allowed for more complex simulations, such as mergers of black holes and neutron stars

 # Excision
- One of the major challenges in NR is dealing with the singularities that form during simulation
- Excision methods were developed to remove these singularities and improve the accuracy of the simulations

 # Punctures
- Another approach to dealing with singularities is through the use of puncture methods
- These methods involve introducing a small amount of matter into the simulation that is not part of the physical system, but rather serves to "puncture" the singularity and allow for its removal

 # 2005's Breakthrough (annus mirabilis of numerical relativity)
- In 2005, a series of breakthroughs in NR were made, including the first simulations of the merger of two black holes and the detection of gravitational waves
- These results marked a major milestone in the field and demonstrated the ability to simulate some of the most extreme astrophysical phenomena in the universe

 # Lazarus Project
- The Lazarus project is an ongoing effort to revive and improve upon the original simulations from 2005
- This project aims to push the boundaries of NR further, by improving the accuracy and resolution of the simulations

 # **Adaptive Mesh Refinement**
- Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a numerical technique that allows for the resolution of the simulation to be increased in regions of interest, while maintaining a lower resolution elsewhere
- This technique has been crucial for the development of NR and has allowed for more detailed simulations of complex astrophysical phenomena

 # Recent Developments

- In recent years, there have been a number of advances in NR, including the simulation of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars
- These developments have further demonstrated the power of NR for understanding some of the most extreme astrophysical phenomena in the universe

 # **Notes**
- NR is a rapidly evolving field, with new techniques and applications being developed all the time
- The field is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on expertise from physics, mathematics, computer science, and engineering
- Ongoing research in NR has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe and the behavior of matter and energy within it.
