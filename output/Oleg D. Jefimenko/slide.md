 # **Electromagnetic Analogy of Gravitational and Cogravitational Fields**

- Jefimenko's work on gravity theory focused on an electromagnetic analogy of gravitational and cogravitational fields.
- He argued that the gravitational field can be described as a kind of "electromagnetic wave" in a curved spacetime, and that the cogravitational field (the field that reacts to the presence of mass and energy) can be described as an electromagnetic field.

 # Generalized Theory of Gravitation

- Jefimenko developed a generalized theory of gravitation that incorporates both the gravitational and cogravitational fields.
- This theory allows for the description of various phenomena such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the behavior of matter in strong gravitational fields.
