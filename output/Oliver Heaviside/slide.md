 # Early Life


Heaviside was born in London, England on May 18, 1850 to a family of modest means. His father was a clerk, and his mother was a pianist and composer. Heaviside was educated at home and showed an early talent for mathematics and science.

 # Middle Years

Heaviside studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1872. After completing his studies, he worked as a private tutor and then as a clerk in the British civil service. During this time, Heaviside began to develop his ideas about electromagnetism and published several papers on the subject.

 # Later Years


In 1881, Heaviside left the civil service and devoted himself full-time to his scientific work. He became a prolific writer and publisher of papers on electromagnetism, tensor analysis, and differential equations. In 1887, he introduced the concept of the "electric fluid" which later became known as the "Heaviside layer."

 # **Views**

Heaviside was a strong advocate for the use of mathematical notation and the development of rigorous mathematical techniques in physics. He believed that physical phenomena could be understood more deeply and accurately through the use of mathematical models.
