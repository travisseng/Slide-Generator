 # **Introduction to Panning**
- Definition of panning: the act of moving the camera horizontally while taking a photo to capture a sense of motion or blur in the background.
- Also known as "tracking" or "following" the subject.

 # **Types of Panning**

- Horizontal panning: moving the camera horizontally to capture a blurred background.
- Vertical panning: moving the camera vertically to create a sense of height or depth.
- Multi-axis panning: moving the camera in multiple directions to create a more complex and dynamic image.

 # _Techniques for Effective Panning_
- Predicting the subject's movement: anticipating where the subject will be and when it will move, allowing you to pan the camera accordingly.
- Following the subject with the camera: keeping the subject in frame while panning the camera.
- Adjusting shutter speed and aperture: adjusting these settings to achieve the desired amount of blur and depth of field.

 # **Examples of Panning in Still Photography**

- Sports photography: capturing athletes in action, often using horizontal panning to convey speed and movement.
- Wildlife photography: tracking animals as they move, using vertical panning to create a sense of height and depth.
- Urban photography: capturing the dynamic energy of cityscapes, often using multi-axis panning to create a more complex composition.

- Experiment with different shutter speeds and apertures: find the settings that work best for your style of panning.
- Use a tripod or monopod for stability: helps to keep the camera steady and avoid camera shake.
