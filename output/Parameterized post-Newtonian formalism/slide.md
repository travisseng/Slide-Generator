 # **History**
- The development of PPN formalism can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s, when physicists began exploring alternatives to general relativity (GR) for describing gravitational phenomena.
- The PPN framework was established as a systematic way of extending GR beyond its limits, allowing for the inclusion of effects from new physics at high energies or large distances.

 # Beta-Delta Notation

- In PPN formalism, quantities like the gravitational constant G and the speed of light c are replaced by " beta-delta" functions, which capture the effects of new physics.
- The beta-delta notation provides a way to parameterize the deviations from GR in a systematic and flexible manner.

 # _Alpha-Zeta Notation_

- An alternative notation to beta-delta is the "alpha-zeta" system, which uses different parameters to describe the deviations from GR.
- Both notations are equivalent and can be used interchangeably in different contexts.

 # How to Apply PPN
- To apply PPN formalism, one needs to specify a set of beta-delta or alpha-zeta functions that describe the deviations from GR.
- These functions can be constrained by experimental data, allowing for a systematic exploration of the parameter space of modified theories of gravity.

 # Comparisons between Theories of Gravity

- PPN formalism provides a framework for comparing different theories of gravity, such as scalar-tensor theories, vector-tensor theories, and bimetric theories.
- By using the same beta-delta or alpha-zeta functions to describe the deviations from GR, one can systematically compare the predictions of different theories.

 # Accuracy from Experimental Tests

- PPN formalism has been used to test the accuracy of experimental results in gravitational physics, such as the observation of binary pulsars and the measurement of the gravitational redshift.
- By comparing the predictions of modified theories of gravity with experimental data, one can constrain the parameter space of these theories and gain insight into the nature of gravity at high energies or large distances.

 # Conclusion
- PPN formalism provides a powerful tool for exploring the parameter space of modified theories of gravity and testing their accuracy against experimental data.
- The beta-delta and alpha-zeta notations offer a flexible and systematic way to describe the deviations from GR, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the structure of spacetime at high energies or large distances.
