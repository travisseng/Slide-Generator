<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction

- PDEs are used to model various phenomena in physics, engineering, and other fields
- Examples include heat conduction, wave propagation, and fluid dynamics

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Well-posedness**
- A well-posed problem is one where the solution exists and is unique
- The initial/boundary value problem is well-posed if the data is sufficient to determine the solution uniquely


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **The Energy Method**
- The energy method involves using the concept of energy to study PDEs
- The energy functional is defined as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Existence of Local Solutions
- The existence of local solutions for PDEs can be studied using the energy method
- The energy method provides a way to prove the existence of at least one local solution


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Classification

- PDEs can be classified into different types based on the number of independent variables and the nature of the equations
- Examples include linear and nonlinear equations, first-order and second-order equations

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Notation

- Standard notation for PDEs includes capital letters for the dependent variable and lowercase letters for the independent variables
- The order of a PDE is the number of independent variables it involves

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Equations of First Order

- First-order PDEs involve only one independent variable
- Examples include the wave equation and the heat equation

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Linear and Nonlinear Equations_
- Linear PDEs have the form $L[u] = f$ where $L$ is a linear operator and $f$ is a given function
- Nonlinear PDEs do not have this form and are more difficult to solve


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Linear Equations of Second Order
- Second-order PDEs involve two independent variables
- Examples include the wave equation and the heat equation in two dimensions


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Systems of First-Order Equations and Characteristic Surfaces
- Systems of first-order PDEs can be studied using characteristic surfaces
- Characteristic surfaces are used to reduce the system of equations to a set of ordinary differential equations


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Analytical Solutions

- Analytical solutions are exact solutions that can be expressed in terms of known functions and constants
- Examples include the solutions of the wave equation and the heat equation

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Separation of Variables
- The separation of variables method involves separating the dependent and independent variables into different functions
- This method is useful for solving linear PDEs


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Method of Characteristics

- The method of characteristics involves solving PDEs by following the characteristics of the equations
- This method is useful for solving first-order PDEs

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Integral Transform

- The integral transform is a technique used to solve PDEs by converting them into an integral equation
- Examples include the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Change of Variables_
- The change of variables method involves changing the independent variables in a PDE to simplify the equations
- This method is useful for solving nonlinear PDEs


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # _Fundamental Solution_
- The fundamental solution is a solution of a PDE that satisfies certain properties, such as being non-zero and having a finite limit as the independent variable approaches infinity


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Superposition Principle_
- The superposition principle states that any solution of a PDE can be expressed as the sum of simpler solutions
- This principle is useful for solving linear PDEs


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Methods for Non-Linear Equations_
- There are several methods for solving nonlinear PDEs, including the Lie group method and semianalytical methods
- These methods involve using the structure of the equations to reduce them to a set of ordinary differential equations


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Numerical Solutions
- Numerical solutions involve approximating the solution of a PDE using numerical methods, such as finite element, finite difference, and finite volume methods
- These methods are useful for solving large-scale PDEs that cannot be solved analytically


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Data-Driven Solution of Partial Differential Equations
- The data-driven solution of PDEs involves using numerical methods to solve the equations using data as input
- This approach is useful for solving problems where the PDEs are too complex to be solved analytically
