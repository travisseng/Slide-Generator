 # Basic Properties of Penrose Diagrams

- Definition of a Penrose diagram: a chart-like representation of a spacetime with a single future-directed timelike curve
- Characteristics of a Penrose diagram: global causality, local causality, and the curvature of spacetime
- Examples of different types of Penrose diagrams (e.g. stationary, dynamical)
