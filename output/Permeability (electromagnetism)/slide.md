 # _Permeability (electromagnetism)_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Explanation

- Permeability is a measure of how easily magnetic fields can pass through a material
- It is defined as the ratio of the magnetic field strength inside the material to the magnetic field strength outside the material

 # _Relative Permeability and Magnetic Susceptibility_
- Relative permeability is the ratio of the magnetic permeability of a material to the magnetic permeability of vacuum (a perfect diamagnetic material)
- Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how much a material is affected by an external magnetic field

 # Diamagnetism

- Diamagnetism is the weak repulsion of magnetic fields by materials that have a low magnetic permeability
- Diamagnetic materials have a negative relative permeability, meaning they tend to push away magnetic fields

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Paramagnetism**

- Paramagnetism is the attraction of magnetic fields by materials that have a high magnetic permeability
- Paramagnetic materials have a positive relative permeability, meaning they tend to attract magnetic fields

 # Gyromagnetism

- Gyromagnetism is a phenomenon where the magnetic susceptibility of a material changes with temperature
- Some materials exhibit gyromagnetic behavior, meaning their magnetic susceptibility increases or decreases as the temperature changes

 # Values for some common materials
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Here are some examples of the relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility of some common materials:

+ Air: εr = 1, χm = 0 (diamagnetic)

+ Water: εr = 80-90, χm = 0.1-0.2 (diamagnetic)

+ Iron: εr = 100-200, χm = -40 to -60 (paramagnetic)

+ Copper: εr = 30-40, χm = -0.2 to -0.5 (diamagnetic)

 # Complex Permeability

- The complex permeability of a material is a measure of its magnetic properties in the frequency domain
- It is defined as the ratio of the magnetic field strength inside the material to the magnetic field strength outside the material, both expressed as complex quantities

 # Notes
- Permeability is an important property in electromagnetism and is used in a wide range of applications, including magnets, motors, generators, and transformers.
- The permeability of a material can be affected by temperature, frequency, and other factors.
- Understanding the permeability of materials is crucial for designing and optimizing electromagnetic devices.

I hope this presentation helps you understand the concept of permeability in electromagnetism! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
