 # The Ampere-Defined Vacuum Permeability
- Definition: Permeability of free space (μ0) is a measure of the ability of a vacuum to support magnetic fields.
- Units: H/m (Henries per meter)

 # Terminology

- Permeability: A measure of the ease with which a medium allows a magnetic field to pass through it.
- Magnetic permeability: A measure of the ability of a material or space to support a magnetic field.
- Free space: The vacuum of space, devoid of matter and radiation.

 # Systems of Units and Historical Origin of Value of μ0
- The value of μ0 was defined by André-Marie Ampère in 1820 as 1/4π × 10^(-7) H/m.
- It is based on the assumption that the Earth's magnetic field is uniform and that the vacuum permeability is the same as the permeability of air at sea level.

 # **Significance in Electromagnetism**

- Permeability of free space plays a crucial role in electromagnetic theory, particularly in the study of magnetic fields and their behavior in vacuum and other media.
- It is used to calculate the magnetic field strength and the flux of a magnetic field through a surface.

 # Notes
- The value of μ0 is a fundamental constant that is used in many areas of physics, including electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and relativity.
- It is important to note that μ0 is not the permeability of a specific material or space, but rather a universal constant that applies to all vacuums.
- The value of μ0 has been measured in various experiments and its accuracy has been verified by many measurements and observations.
