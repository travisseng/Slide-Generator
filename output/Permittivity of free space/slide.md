 # Value
- Definition: The permittivity of free space (denoted by ε0) is a fundamental constant that describes the ability of free space to support electric fields.
- Value: ε0 = 8.854187817... x 10^-12 F/m (exact value)

 # Redefinition of the SI Units
- In 2019, the International System of Units (SI) was redefined to remove the concept of "permittivity of free space" and instead define the electric constant (denoted by ε) as a derived quantity.
- The value of ε0 is now defined as: ε0 = √(4π × σ0), where σ0 is the vacuum resistivity.

 # _Terminology_

- Permittivity: A measure of how much a material supports electric fields.
- Free space: The idealized vacuum in which electromagnetic waves propagate without interaction.

 # Historical Origin of the Parameter ε0

- The concept of permittivity of free space was first introduced by James Clerk Maxwell in his 1864 treatise on electricity and magnetism.
- He used it to describe the behavior of electromagnetic waves in a medium with zero resistance (now known as vacuum).

 # Rationalization of Units
- The concept of permittivity of free space was rationalized by Einstein in 1905, who introduced the idea that electric and magnetic fields are equivalent and can be described using a single field strength (the "electromagnetic tensor").

 # **Determination of a Value for ε0**

- The value of ε0 was first determined by experiment in the early 20th century using techniques such as dielectric spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy.
- More recent measurements have been performed using advanced techniques such as microwave cavity measurements and optical frequency domain reflections.

 # Permittivity of Real Media
- The permittivity of real media (such as solids, liquids, and gases) is often described using the concept of "effective permittivity" (denoted by εeff).
- The effective permittivity takes into account the effects of material properties such as conductivity, dielectric constant, and magnetic permeability.

 # Notes

- Permittivity of free space is a fundamental constant that describes the ability of free space to support electric fields.
- The value of ε0 has been precisely measured using advanced techniques, and its redefinition in 2019 simplified the definition of the electric constant.
- Understanding permittivity is important for understanding various phenomena in physics and engineering, such as electromagnetic waves, capacitors, and dielectrics.
