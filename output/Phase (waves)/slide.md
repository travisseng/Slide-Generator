 # Introduction

- Phase is a fundamental concept in wave theory and is used to describe the timing of waves relative to each other.
- In this presentation, we will explore the mathematical definition of phase, its consequences, and how to compare and shift phases.

 # **Mathematical Definition of Phase**

- The phase of a wave is defined as the angle between the wave and a reference line or axis.
- The phase can be measured in radians or degrees.
- The phase of a wave can be represented graphically using a sinusoidal curve.

 # Consequences of Phase

- The phase of a wave determines when it arrives relative to other waves.
- If two waves have the same frequency but different phases, they will overlap and produce an interference pattern.
- If two waves have different frequencies, the wave with the higher frequency will dominate and the wave with the lower frequency will be overpowered.

 # Adding and Comparing Phases

- To add or compare the phases of two waves, we need to align them properly.
- When adding or comparing phases, it's important to consider the relative position of the peaks and troughs of the waves.
- The phase difference between two waves can be calculated using the following formula: φ = (θ2 - θ1) mod 360°, where φ is the phase difference, θ1 and θ2 are the phases of the two waves.

 # Phase Shift

- A phase shift occurs when the phase of a wave is changed by some amount.
- The amount of the phase shift can be measured in radians or degrees.
- A phase shift can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a change in the frequency of the wave or a delay in the arrival time of the wave.

 # _For Sinusoids_
- When dealing with sinusoidal waves, we can use the following formula to calculate the phase of a wave: φ = (2πft) + C, where φ is the phase, f is the frequency, t is time, and C is the constant phase shift.
- The phase of a sinusoidal wave remains constant over one period, but it changes over multiple periods.

 # For Shifted Signals
- When dealing with shifted signals, we need to consider the relative position of the peaks and troughs of the waves.
- To compare the phases of two shifted signals, we can use the following formula: φ = (θ2 - θ1) mod 360°, where φ is the phase difference, θ1 and θ2 are the phases of the two signals.
- The phase difference between two shifted signals can be calculated by considering the relative position of the peaks and troughs of the waves.

- When dealing with sinusoidal waves with the same frequency, we can use the following formula to calculate the phase difference between two waves: φ = (2πft) + C1 - C2, where φ is the phase difference, f is the frequency, t is time, C1 and C2 are the constant phase shifts of the two waves.
- The phase difference between two sinusoidal waves with the same frequency can be calculated by considering the relative position of the peaks and troughs of the waves.
