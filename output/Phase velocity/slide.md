 # Introduction
- Phase velocity is an important concept in physics that refers to the speed at which a wave or a pulse travels through a medium.
- In this presentation, we will explore the relationship between phase velocity and refractive index, and how it affects the behavior of waves.

- The group velocity is the speed at which a pulse or wave packet travels through a medium.
- It is defined as the average speed of the wave over a given time period.
- The group velocity is an important concept in understanding the behavior of waves and their interaction with matter.

 # Refractive Index

- The refractive index is a measure of how much a wave is slowed down as it passes through a medium.
- It is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.
- The refractive index is an important parameter in understanding the behavior of waves and their interaction with matter.

 # Phase Velocity

- The phase velocity is the speed at which the wave fronts or pulse waves travel through a medium.
- It is defined as the ratio of the wavelength to the time it takes for the wave to travel a certain distance.
- The phase velocity is an important concept in understanding the behavior of waves and their interaction with matter.
