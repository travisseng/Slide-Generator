<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Emission Mechanism
- Explanation of the photoelectric effect: when light is absorbed by a material, it can eject electrons from the material's surface.
- Discussion of the different mechanisms for emission: thermal, field-emission, and photoemission.
