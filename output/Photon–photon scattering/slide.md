 # _Introduction_
- Photon-photon scattering is an important process in astrophysics and cosmology
- Photons can scatter off each other through various mechanisms, such as Thomson scattering and Compton scattering

 # Astronomy

- Photon-photon scattering plays a crucial role in understanding the origins of the universe
- In the early universe, photons were the dominant form of radiation
- Photon-photon scattering can help us understand the temperature and composition of the early universe

 # Cosmological/Intergalactic Gamma Rays

- Gamma rays are high-energy photons that can be produced by the interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium
- Photon-photon scattering can contribute to the production of gamma rays in astrophysical sources such as supernovae remnants and active galactic nuclei

 # **Experiments**

- Experimental detection of photon-photon scattering is challenging due to the low cross section and the high background noise
- Current and future experiments aim to detect and study photon-photon scattering in various astrophysical sources, such as the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the Cherenkov Telescope Array

 # _Processes_
- Photon-photon scattering can occur through several mechanisms, including Thomson scattering, Compton scattering, and pair production
- Each mechanism has a distinct signature that can be used to study the properties of the astrophysical source and the photon-photon interaction
