 # _Introduction_
- Definition of pollutants: substances or energy that have a negative impact on the environment, human health, or well-being
- Types of pollutants: air, water, soil, noise


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Different types of pollutants in the environment

- Air pollutants: particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO)
- Water pollutants: heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals, sewage, oil spills
- Soil pollutants: heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals, radioactive substances
- Noise pollution: excessive noise from transportation, construction, or other sources

 # Stock pollutants
- Pollutants that are present in the environment at all times, such as background radiation and natural particulate matter


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Fund pollutants
- Pollutants that are introduced into the environment through human activities, such as industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Specific groups of pollutants
- Heavy metals: lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium
- Pesticides: organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates
- Industrial chemicals: solvents, dyes, fragrances
- Sewage and wastewater: bacteria, viruses, parasites, organic matter

 # _Light pollutants_

- Artificial light at night, such as from streetlights and buildings, can disrupt natural light cycles and have negative impacts on human health and the environment

 # Zones of influence

- Horizontal zone: area surrounding a source of pollution that is affected by it (e.g. neighborhood near a factory)
- Vertical zone: altitude range within which a pollutant can be detected (e.g. stratosphere)

 # Measuring concentration

- Methods for measuring the concentration of pollutants in the environment include sampling and laboratory analysis, as well as remote sensing technologies such as satellite imaging

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Regulation
- National and international regulations aim to limit the amount of pollutants that can be released into the environment
- Examples of regulations include the Clean Air Act in the United States and the European Union's Air Quality Directive


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _International and European Union regulations_
- The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) sets international standards for environmental protection
- The European Union has implemented a number of directives and regulations aimed at reducing pollution, including the Air Quality Directive and the Water Framework Directive


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # United States regulations
- The Clean Air Act is the primary legislation regulating air quality in the United States
- Other regulations include the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act

 # Conclusion
- Pollutants can have a significant impact on human health and the environment, and it is important to understand the different types of pollutants and their effects
- Regulations and international agreements aim to limit the amount of pollution in the environment, but more work needs to be done to protect public health and the environment.
