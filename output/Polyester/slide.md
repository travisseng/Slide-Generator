 # _Introduction to Polyester_

- A synthetic polymer made from petrochemicals
- Used in a wide range of applications, including textiles, plastics, and industrial materials

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Types of Polyester

- Aliphatic polyesters (e.g. poly(lactic acid))
- Aromatic polyesters (e.g. polyethylene terephthalate)

 # Natural Polyesters
- Cellulose (found in plant cell walls)
- Chitin (found in crustacean exoskeletons)

 # Synthetic Polyesters

- Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
- Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)

 # Aliphatic vs. Aromatic Polymers
- Aliphatic polymers have a chain-like structure, while aromatic polymers have a ring-like structure
- Aliphatic polymers are typically biodegradable, while aromatic polymers are not

 # _Thermodynamics of Polycondensation Reactions_
- Polycondensation reactions involve the condensation of two or more monomers to form a polymer
- The thermodynamics of these reactions are influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and reaction conditions

 # Biodegradation and Environmental Concerns
- Polyester is not biodegradable and can persist in the environment for hundreds of years
- This has led to concerns about the environmental impact of polyester production and disposal

 # _Pollution of Freshwater and Seawater Habitats_
- Polyester production can result in the release of pollutants into freshwater and seawater habitats
- This can have negative impacts on aquatic life and ecosystems

 # **Recycling of Polyester**

- Polyester is recyclable, but the process is not yet well-developed
- Efforts are being made to improve the recyclability and sustainability of polyester materials

 # Conclusion

- Polyester is a versatile and widely used synthetic polymer with many applications
- However, its environmental impact and lack of biodegradability are concerns that must be addressed in order to ensure a sustainable future for this material.
