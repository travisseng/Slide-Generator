 # Proper Length or Rest Length
- Definition: Proper length, also known as rest length, is the distance between two points in space when no forces are acting upon an object.
- Example: Consider a ball at rest on a table. The distance between the ball and the table is the proper length of the ball.
- Importance: Proper length is a fundamental concept in physics that helps us understand the behavior of objects under different conditions.

 # Proper Distance Between Two Events in Flat Space
- Definition: Proper distance is the distance between two events in flat space, such as two points or two events that occur at different times.
- Formula: The proper distance between two events A and B can be calculated using the formula dAB = sqrt((tB - tA)^2 - (xB - xA)^2), where tA and tB are the times of the events, and xA and xB are their positions.
- Example: Consider two events, A and B, that occur at different times and locations in flat space. The proper distance between them is the distance calculated using the formula above.
- Importance: Proper distance is essential in understanding the behavior of objects in flat space and how they relate to each other.

 # Proper Distance Along a Path

- Definition: Proper distance along a path is the distance traveled by an object along a curved path, taking into account the curvature of the path.
- Formula: The proper distance along a path can be calculated using the formula d = ∫(ds) / λ, where ds is the element of the path, and λ is the affine parameter.
- Example: Consider an object moving along a curved path, such as a circle. The proper distance traveled by the object along the path is the distance calculated using the formula above.
- Importance: Proper distance along a path is crucial in understanding the behavior of objects in curved space and how they move along complex paths.

I hope this slide presentation helps you understand proper length and its importance in physics!
