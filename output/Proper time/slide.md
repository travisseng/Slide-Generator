 # Proper time

 # **Mathematical Formalism**

- Proper time is a concept in relativity that refers to the time experienced by an observer in a specific frame of reference.
- In mathematical terms, proper time is defined as the time interval between two events measured in the rest frame of the observer.

 # In Special Relativity

- In special relativity, proper time is affected by time dilation and length contraction.
- As an object moves faster than the speed of light, time dilation causes time to appear to slow down for an observer on the object.
- Length contraction causes objects to appear shorter in the direction of motion.

 # **Examples in Special Relativity**
- Example 1: The Twin Paradox

+ Supposing one twin travels at high speed relative to the other, they will experience time dilation and age less than their stationary twin.

+ However, both twins will agree on the time that has passed between them.
- Example 2: The Rotating Disk

+ If a disk is rotating at high speed, an observer on the disk will experience time dilation and see clocks on the rotating frame as slower than their own.

 # In General Relativity

- In general relativity, proper time is affected by gravitational time dilation and curvature of spacetime.
- Gravitational time dilation causes time to appear to slow down closer to a massive object, such as a black hole.

 # Examples in General Relativity
- Example 3: The Rotating Disk (Again)

+ If a disk is rotating at high speed in a gravitational field, an observer on the disk will experience both time dilation and curvature of spacetime.

+ They will see clocks on the rotating frame as slower than their own due to time dilation, and the spacetime around them will appear curved due to the gravitational field.
- Example 4: The Schwarzschild Solution â€“ Time on the Earth

+ If we consider a massive object such as the Earth, its gravity causes time dilation and curvature of spacetime.

+ However, the effect is negligible at the surface of the Earth, but becomes more pronounced near the center of the planet.

Footnotes:
- Proper time is not a fixed quantity, but rather depends on the frame of reference and the specific laws of physics being considered.
- Time dilation and length contraction are fundamental aspects of special relativity, while gravitational time dilation and curvature of spacetime are key features of general relativity.
- The twin paradox and rotating disk examples illustrate how proper time can be affected by relative motion and gravity.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the concepts discussed.
