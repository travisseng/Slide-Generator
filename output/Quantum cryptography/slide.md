 # Introduction
- Quantum cryptography is a method of secure communication that uses quantum mechanics to encode and decode messages
- Also known as quantum key distribution (QKD)

 # History
- Quantum cryptography was first proposed by Bennett and Brassard in the 1980s
- First experimental implementation was in 1993 by Gisin et al.
- Since then, quantum cryptography has been developed and commercialized for various applications

 # Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

- QKD is a method of secure key exchange using quantum mechanics
- Two parties can share a secret key over an insecure channel
- Eavesdropping attempts can be detected by measuring the quantum state of the photons exchanged
