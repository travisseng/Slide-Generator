- Quantum Gravity (QG) is a theoretical framework that seeks to unify two fundamental theories of physics: General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM)
- Goal: Develop a consistent and complete theory that describes the behavior of gravity and matter at very small and very large scales

- GR is a theory of gravitation that describes how mass and energy warp spacetime
- QM is a theory of the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level
- Both theories are well-established and successful, but they are fundamentally incompatible within the framework of classical physics

 # **Graviton**
- In QG, the graviton is a hypothetical particle that mediates the force of gravity
- The graviton is thought to be a massless particle, similar to the photon in QED
- The existence of the graviton is still a topic of debate and research in QG


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Nonrenormalizability of gravity**

- In contrast to QM and GR, the theory of gravity is nonrenormalizable, meaning that the theory is not well-defined at very small distances (i.e., high energies)
- This makes it difficult to develop a consistent and complete QG theory

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Quantum gravity as an effective field theory

- One approach to QG is to treat it as an effective field theory, where the theory is valid at low energies but breaks down at high energies
- In this approach, the theory is constructed by integrating out the high-energy degrees of freedom, resulting in an effective theory that describes the behavior of gravity and matter at low energies

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Spacetime background dependence

- In QG, the spacetime background is dynamical and depends on the distribution of matter and energy
- This is in contrast to GR, where the spacetime background is fixed and does not depend on the distribution of matter and energy

<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- String theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify QM and GR within a single theory
- In string theory, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like particles
- String theory is still an active area of research in QG

 # Background independent theories
- Background independent theories, such as Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT), do not rely on a fixed spacetime background
- Instead, these theories describe the behavior of geometry and matter in terms of a network of triads and simplices


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Semi-classical quantum gravity
- Semi-classical QG is an approach that combines elements of both classical GR and quantum mechanics
- In this approach, the theory is based on a fixed spacetime background, but the matter fields are treated quantum mechanically


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Problem of time

- One of the major challenges in QG is the problem of time, which refers to the difficulty of defining a well-behaved notion of time within the framework of QG
- This problem arises because of the nonrenormalizability of gravity and the lack of a well-defined time scale at very small distances

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Candidate theories_

- There are several candidate theories for QG, including string theory, LQG, CDT, and others
- Each of these theories has its strengths and weaknesses, and the ultimate success of QG will depend on the development of a consistent and complete theory that can explain all of the observed phenomena in the universe

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Experimental tests
- Experimental tests of QG are challenging due to the extremely high energies and very small distances involved
- However, several experimental approaches are being explored, including gravitational wave detection, high-energy particle collisions, and others

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # _Notes_

- QG is a highly active area of research, with many open questions and competing theories
- The development of QG will depend on the resolution of these open questions and the emergence of a consistent and complete theory
- QG has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe and the behavior of gravity and matter at very small and very large scales.
