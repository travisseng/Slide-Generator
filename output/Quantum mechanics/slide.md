 # Quantum mechanics

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Overview and Fundamental Concepts
- Quantum mechanics is a theoretical framework that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales.
- It is based on the principles of wave-particle duality, uncertainty, and probabilistic nature of physical phenomena.

- Quantum mechanics is formulated using mathematical equations, such as the Schrödinger equation and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
- These equations provide a framework for calculating the probability of different physical outcomes.

 # Uncertainty Principle
- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with infinite precision at the same time.
- This principle is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has important implications for understanding the behavior of particles.

 # _Composite Systems and Entanglement_
- Quantum mechanics can be used to describe the behavior of composite systems, such as molecules and solids.
- Entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Equivalence Between Formulations

- Quantum mechanics can be formulated using different mathematical frameworks, such as the Schrödinger equation and the path integral.
- These formulations are equivalent and provide different perspectives on the same physical phenomena.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Symmetries and Conservation Laws
- Quantum mechanics exhibits certain symmetries, such as time-reversal symmetry and rotational symmetry.
- These symmetries can be used to simplify calculations and understand the behavior of particles.
- Conservation laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum, are also important in quantum mechanics.

 # Examples

- Simple examples of quantum systems include the free particle, the particle in a box, and the harmonic oscillator.
- These systems can be used to illustrate fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle.

 # Mach–Zehnder Interferometer
- The Mach–Zehnder interferometer is an experimental setup that demonstrates quantum interference and the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena.
- It consists of two paths with different lengths, and the probability of detecting a particle at different points along the paths depends on the relative phase between the two paths.
