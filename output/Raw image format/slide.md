 # Raw image format

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Rationale_

- Raw image format is a digital image file that captures the raw data from the camera sensor, without any in-camera processing or compression.
- This allows for greater flexibility and creative control during post-processing.

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.80em}</style>

 # File Contents
- A Raw image file contains unprocessed data from the camera sensor, including:

+ Image dimensions (width and height)

+ Pixel count (number of pixels in each dimension)

+ Bit depth (number of color channels, typically 12 or 14 bits)

+ Compression (some Raw files are compressed, while others are not)

 # Sensor Image Data

- Raw image files contain the raw data from the camera sensor, which can be processed to produce a final image.
- This data includes the intensity of each pixel (brightness), as well as color information (if the camera has a color sensor).

 # **Standardization**
- Raw image format is not a standardized format, but rather a collection of different formats used by various camera manufacturers.
- This can make it difficult to process Raw files from different cameras using the same software.

 # Processing
- Raw image files are typically processed using specialized software, such as Adobe Camera Raw or Lightroom.
- These programs allow for a wide range of adjustments and edits, including white balance, exposure, and color correction.
