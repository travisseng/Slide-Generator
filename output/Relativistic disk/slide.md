 # Definition of Relativistic Disks

"A relativistic disk is a rotating, thin, and massive body that is in a state of relativity. It is characterized by its high angular velocity and its ability to affect the surrounding space-time."

 # Formation of Relativistic Disks


"Relativistic disks form when a massive body, such as a star or a black hole, collapses under its own gravity. The collapse causes the body to rotate rapidly, creating a disk of matter that is in a state of relativity."
