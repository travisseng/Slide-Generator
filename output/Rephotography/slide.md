 # Introduction to Rephotography

- Definition of rephotography: taking photographs of the same location and subject over time to document changes and movements
- Also known as "serial photography" or "repeating photography"

 # Rephotography in the Sciences

- Used in fields such as geology, ecology, meteorology, and astronomy to monitor changes in landscapes, vegetation, weather patterns, and celestial bodies over time
- Examples: tracking glacier retreat, monitoring forest regrowth, observing seasonal changes in plant life, studying the movement of tectonic plates

 # Rephotography in Social Investigation
- Used in sociology, anthropology, and urban planning to document changes in communities, buildings, and landscapes over time
- Examples: tracking urban gentrification, monitoring the impact of development projects on local ecosystems, documenting the evolution of neighborhoods and cultural practices

 # **Procedures and Techniques**

- Camera equipment: standard or specialized cameras, lenses, tripods, and filters may be used depending on the specific application and requirements
- Image capture: photographs are taken at regular intervals using a consistent setup and angle to ensure comparability between images
- Georeferencing: GPS coordinates or other geospatial data may be collected to accurately locate each photograph in space and time
