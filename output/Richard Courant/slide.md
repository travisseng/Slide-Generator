 # _Perspective on Mathematics_
- Courant believed that mathematics should be taught as a tool for understanding the world, rather than simply as a subject to be mastered.
- He emphasized the importance of problem-solving and practical applications in mathematical education.
- Courant was also known for his focus on the beauty and elegance of mathematical concepts, rather than just their utility.
