 # _Controlling Body_

- The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is responsible for maintaining and overseeing the SI system
- The BIPM is a non-governmental organization that brings together experts from around the world to ensure the consistency and coherence of the SI system

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Overview of the Units**
- The SI system is based on seven base units: meter, kilogram, second, Kelvin, ampere, candela, and mole
- These base units are used to derive all other units in the system


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.72em}</style>

 # SI Base Units
- Meter (m): length unit
- Kilogram (kg): mass unit
- Second (s): time unit
- Kelvin (K): thermodynamic temperature unit
- Ampere (A): electric current unit
- Candela (cd): luminous intensity unit
- Mole (mol): amount of substance unit


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # SI Derived Units
- Derived units are created by combining the base units in various ways
- Examples include velocity (m/s), force (N), and energy (J)


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Why Keep the Distinction Between Base and Derived Units?

- The distinction between base and derived units is important for maintaining the coherence of the SI system
- It allows for a clear and consistent way of expressing physical quantities

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _SI Metric Prefixes and the Decimal Nature of the SI_

- The SI system uses metric prefixes to express multiples and submultiples of the base units
- The decimal nature of the SI system makes it easy to perform calculations and conversions

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Coherent and Non-Coherent SI Units_

- Coherent units are those that can be derived from the base units using only the defined operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation
- Non-coherent units are those that cannot be derived from the base units in this way

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Permitted Non-SI Units
- Some non-SI units are permitted for use with the SI system, such as degrees Celsius for temperature and pounds for mass


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _New Units_

- The SI system is not static and has evolved over time to include new units as needed
- Examples include the use of the byte for digital information and the yocto- (yocto-) for very small quantities

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Defining Magnitudes of Units
- The magnitude of a unit is its numerical value, such as 1 meter or 1 kilogram
- The definition of the magnitude of a unit is important for maintaining the consistency of the SI system


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Specifying Fundamental Constants vs. Other Methods of Definition
- The SI system defines some quantities using fundamental physical constants, such as the speed of light and the Planck constant
- Other methods of definition include using the properties of materials or the behavior of physical systems


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # History of the SI System
- The SI system has its roots in the French Revolution, when the meter was first defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole
- The system has evolved over time to include new units and refine existing ones


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Controlling Authority
- The controlling authority for the SI system is the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)
- The BIPM is responsible for maintaining and overseeing the consistency and coherence of the SI system


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Units and Prefixes
