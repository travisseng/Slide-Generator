 # Schwarzschild metric

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.84em}</style>

 # Formulation
- The Schwarzschild metric describes the spacetime around a spherically symmetric mass
- It is given by the line element:

ds^2 = (1 - 2GM/r) dt^2 - (1 - 2GM/r)^{-1} dr^2 - r^2 d\theta^2 - r^2 sin^2\theta d\phi^2

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and r is the radial distance from the center of the object.

 # History
- The Schwarzschild metric was developed by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 as a solution to Einstein's general theory of relativity
- It was the first solution to be found, and it has been widely used in the study of black holes and other astrophysical objects

 # _Singularities and Black Holes_
- The Schwarzschild metric contains a singularity at r = 0, where the curvature of spacetime is infinite
- This singularity is surrounded by an event horizon, beyond which nothing (not even light) can escape the gravitational pull of the object
- The event horizon is located at r = 2GM, and it marks the boundary between the region that is accessible to observers and the region that is not.

 # Alternative Coordinates
- The Schwarzschild metric can be expressed in alternative coordinates, such as the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates or the Misner-Sharp coordinates
- These coordinates provide different perspectives on the structure of spacetime and can be useful for analyzing specific aspects of the metric.

 # Flamm's Paraboloid
- The Schwarzschild metric can be represented graphically as a paraboloid, known as Flamm's paraboloid
- This plot shows the relationship between the radial distance and the proper time for an observer at rest outside the event horizon.

 # Orbital Motion
- The Schwarzschild metric describes the motion of objects in the vicinity of a black hole
- The motion is governed by the geodesic equation, which can be solved numerically to determine the orbits of particles and light around the black hole.

 # Symmetries
- The Schwarzschild metric has several symmetries, including spherical symmetry and staticity
- These symmetries simplify the analysis of the metric and make it easier to understand the properties of the spacetime.

 # Curvatures
- The Schwarzschild metric is characterized by strong curvature in the vicinity of the event horizon
- The curvature is responsible for the unusual phenomena that occur around black holes, such as gravitational lensing and time dilation.

 # Notes
- The Schwarzschild metric is a solution to Einstein's general theory of relativity, and it provides a framework for understanding the spacetime structure around massive objects
- The metric has been widely used in the study of black holes and other astrophysical objects, and it has played a central role in the development of modern astrophysics.
