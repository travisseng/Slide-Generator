 # **Scientific modelling**

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Overview_

- Scientific modelling is the process of creating mathematical or computational representations of real-world systems, phenomena, or processes.
- Models can be used to predict the behavior of systems, make hypotheses, and test theories.

 # Basics

- A model is a simplification of reality, representing only the most essential aspects of a system or process.
- Models can be physical, mathematical, or computational, depending on the nature of the system being modelled.

 # **Modelling as a substitute for direct measurement and experimentation**

- In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to measure or experiment with a system directly.
- Models can provide a way to study the behavior of a system without the need for direct measurements or experiments.

 # Simulation

- Simulation is the use of models to predict the behavior of a system over time.
- Simulations can be used to test hypotheses, explore the behavior of a system under different conditions, and train individuals in the use of complex systems.

 # Structure
- Models can have a hierarchical structure, with more detailed models representing subsystems or components of the overall system.
- The structure of a model can vary depending on the nature of the system being modelled and the goals of the modelling exercise.

 # **Systems**

- Models can be used to represent complex systems, such as those found in engineering, economics, biology, and physics.
- Models can be used to study the behavior of individual components of a system, as well as the behavior of the system as a whole.

 # Generating a model
- There are many methods for generating models, including empirical modelling, theoretical modelling, and computational modelling.
- The choice of method will depend on the nature of the system being modelled and the goals of the modelling exercise.

 # Evaluating a model

- Models must be evaluated to ensure that they are accurate and reliable.
- Evaluation can involve comparing the predictions of the model to actual data, as well as testing the model under different conditions.

 # Visualization

- Visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data or models.
- Visualization can be used to communicate the results of a modelling exercise, as well as to explore the behavior of a system.

 # Space mapping

- Space mapping is the process of creating visual representations of high-dimensional data.
- Space mapping can be used to identify patterns and relationships in complex data sets.

 # Types

- There are many different types of models, including mathematical models, computational models, and physical models.
- The choice of model will depend on the nature of the system being modelled and the goals of the modelling exercise.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Applications_

- Models can be used in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics, biology, and physics.
- Models can be used to study the behavior of complex systems, make predictions about future events, and train individuals in the use of complex systems.

 # **Modelling and simulation**
- Modelling and simulation are closely related fields that involve the use of models to represent real-world systems or processes.
- The choice of modelling or simulation technique will depend on the nature of the system being studied and the goals of the exercise.
