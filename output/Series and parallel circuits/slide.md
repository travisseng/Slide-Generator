 # **Series and parallel circuits**

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Introduction

- Series and parallel circuits are two common circuit configurations used in electronic devices
- Understanding the difference between series and parallel circuits is important for designing and analyzing electrical systems

 # Series Circuits

- Definition: A series circuit is a circuit where components are connected one after the other in a linear fashion
- Example: A string of light bulbs connected one after the other is an example of a series circuit
- Advantages:

+ Easy to understand and analyze

+ Each component sees the same voltage and current
- Disadvantages:

+ If one component fails, the entire circuit is affected

+ Limited by the weakest component in the circuit

 # Current

- Definition: The flow of electrons through a conductor
- Measured in amperes (A)
- In a parallel circuit, the current through each component is the same

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Voltage

- Definition: The difference in electric potential between two points in a circuit
- Measured in volts (V)
- In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each component is the same

 # **Resistance Units**
- Definition: A measure of how difficult it is for electrons to flow through a conductor
- Measured in ohms (Î©)
- In a parallel circuit, the total resistance is less than the resistance of any individual component


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Inductors
- Definition: A component that stores energy in a magnetic field
- Measured in henries (H)
- In a series circuit, the inductance of each component is added together


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Capacitors
- Definition: A component that stores energy in an electric field
- Measured in farads (F)
- In a series circuit, the capacitance of each component is added together


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Switches

- Definition: A device that can open or close a circuit
- Can be either manual or automatic
- In a series circuit, a switch can be used to control the flow of current

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # **Cells and Batteries**

- Definition: A device that provides a source of electricity
- Can be either a single cell or a battery pack
- In a series circuit, cells and batteries can be connected in series to increase the voltage and power output

- Definition: A circuit where components are connected between the same two points
- Example: A set of light bulbs connected between the same two points is an example of a parallel circuit
- Advantages:

+ If one component fails, the other components continue to function

+ Each component sees the same current, but different voltage
- Disadvantages:

+ More complex to understand and analyze than series circuits

+ The total resistance of a parallel circuit is less than the resistance of any individual component
