 # History

In 1964, Irwin Shapiro discovered the effect of gravitational redshift on the timing of signals passing near massive objects. This discovery has had a profound impact on our understanding of gravity and its effects on space exploration.

 # **Calculating Time Delay**


To calculate the time delay due to Shapiro effect, we need to know the mass of the object, the distance from the signal source to the observer, and the speed of light. The formula for calculating time delay is: Δt = (2GM/c^3) \* (1/r - 1/d), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, c is the speed of light, r is the distance from the signal source to the observer, and d is the distance from the observer to the signal receiver.

 # Time Delay Due to Light Traveling Around a Single Mass


When light travels around a massive object, such as a star or black hole, it follows a curved path due to the gravitational redshift. This curvature causes a delay in the time it takes for the light to reach the observer. The greater the mass of the object and the closer the light source is to the object, the greater the time delay will be.

 # **Interplanetary Probes**

Because of the Shapiro effect, signals sent between spacecraft and Earth can be delayed by several minutes or even hours. This delay can affect communication and navigation, making it difficult to coordinate activities between the spacecraft and Earth. To overcome this challenge, scientists use advanced techniques such as radio telescopes and precision clocks to measure the time delay accurately.
