 # **History of Social Documentary Photography**

The history of social documentary photography can be traced back to the work of Jacob Riis, who used flash powder to expose the living conditions of immigrants in New York City's tenements in the early 1900s. Other notable photographers in this genre include Lewis Hine, Dorothea Lange, and Walker Evans.

- Lewis Hine's "Child Labor" series (1910s)
- Dorothea Lange's "Migrant Mother" (1936)
