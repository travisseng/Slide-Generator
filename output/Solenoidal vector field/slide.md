 # Solenoidal vector field

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Properties

- Solenoidal vector fields are vector fields that are defined on a manifold and have certain properties, such as being closed and exact
- These properties make solenoidal vector fields useful for studying the geometry and topology of manifolds

 # Etymology
- The term "solenoid" comes from the Greek words "solen" meaning "pipe" and "eidos" meaning "form"
- This refers to the fact that solenoidal vector fields can be thought of as a type of pipe-like structure that encircles a manifold

 # Examples
- One example of a solenoidal vector field is the gradient of a function on a sphere
- Another example is the curl of a vector field on a plane
- Solenoidal vector fields can also be found in electromagnetic theory, where they describe the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire

 # Notes

- Solenoidal vector fields are closely related to other important concepts in mathematics, such as differential forms and de Rham cohomology
- They have applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science
- Solenoidal vector fields can be used to study the properties of manifolds, such as their curvature and topology.
