 # Structure
- Spacetime algebra is a mathematical structure that combines space and time into a single entity.
- It is based on the idea that space and time are not separate entities, but are intertwined as a single fabric called spacetime.

 # _Reciprocal Frame_

- In spacetime algebra, the concept of a frame is replaced by a reciprocal frame, which consists of two basis elements: a timelike element and a spacelike element.
- The reciprocal frame allows for a more flexible and intuitive way of describing motion in spacetime.

 # Spacetime Gradient

- The spacetime gradient is a vector field that describes the rate of change of the spacetime metric.
- It is used to describe the curvature of spacetime and is an important tool for studying gravity and other gravitational phenomena.

 # Spacetime Split

- In spacetime algebra, the spacetime manifold is split into two separate entities: the spatial manifold and the timelike manifold.
- This split allows for a more straightforward description of the geometry of spacetime.

 # Multivector Division
- Multivector division is a mathematical operation that is used to divide a multivector by another multivector.
- It is an important tool for studying the properties of spacetime and the behavior of particles within it.

 # Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics

- In spacetime algebra, quantum mechanics is described using a non-relativistic version of the Schrödinger equation.
- This equation describes the behavior of particles in terms of wave functions and provides a framework for understanding the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

 # **Spacetime Algebra Description of Relativistic Physics**
- Spacetime algebra also provides a powerful framework for describing relativistic physics, including special and general relativity.
- The algebra allows for a more intuitive and straightforward description of the laws of physics in a relativistic context.

 # _Relativistic Quantum Mechanics_
- In spacetime algebra, quantum mechanics is described using a relativistic version of the Schrödinger equation.
- This equation takes into account the effects of special and general relativity and provides a more complete understanding of the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

 # A New Formulation of General Relativity
- Spacetime algebra provides a new and powerful framework for formulating general relativity.
- This formulation allows for a more intuitive and straightforward description of the laws of physics in a gravitational context.
