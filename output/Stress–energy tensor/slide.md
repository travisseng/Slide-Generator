 # Stress–energy tensor

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Definition
- The stress-energy tensor is a mathematical object used to describe the distribution of stress and energy in a given system.
- It is a rank-2 tensor, meaning it has two indices that can be raised or lowered.


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Components

- The stress-energy tensor has four components: three for the stress components (pressure, shear, and tension) and one for the energy density.
- These components can be related to the physical properties of a system, such as its pressure, temperature, and density.

 # Covariant and Mixed Forms
- The stress-energy tensor can be written in two different forms: the covariant form and the mixed form.
- The covariant form is written in terms of the Christoffel symbols and describes the motion of the system in a curved spacetime.
- The mixed form is written in terms of the metric tensor and describes the energy and momentum density of the system in a flat spacetime.

 # Conservation Law
- The stress-energy tensor satisfies a conservation law, which states that the total stress and energy density of a closed system remains constant over time.
- This means that the stress and energy density within the system are balanced by the flow of energy and matter across its boundaries.

 # In Special Relativity

- In special relativity, the stress-energy tensor is related to the four-momentum of a particle.
- The four-momentum is a vector that describes the particle's energy and momentum in four-dimensional spacetime.
