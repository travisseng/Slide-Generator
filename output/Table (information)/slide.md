 # _Table (information)_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Basic Description

- A table is a collection of data arranged in rows and columns
- Each row represents a single record or instance, while each column represents a field or attribute
- Tables are commonly used in databases and spreadsheets to organize and store information

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # Simple Table

- A simple table consists of one or more columns and one or more rows
- Each row has a unique combination of values for the columns
- Simple tables are commonly used in everyday applications such as grocery lists or schedules

 # Multi-Dimensional Table
- A multi-dimensional table is a table with multiple layers of data
- Each layer represents a different dimension or perspective on the data
- Multi-dimensional tables are commonly used in data warehousing and business intelligence to analyze large amounts of data from different angles

- A table can be represented generically as a two-dimensional array of values
- Each element in the array represents a single value in the table
- The dimensions of the array represent the rows and columns of the table
