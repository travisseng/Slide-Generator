 # _Background_
- Taub-NUT space was first proposed by John H.R. Taub and John M. N.H.N. van der Meer in the 1960s
- It is a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that describes the gravitational and electromagnetic fields around a black hole and a cosmic string

 # Geometry

- Taub-NUT space has a singularity at the center of the black hole
- The geometry of the space is described by the Kerr metric, which is a solution of the Einstein field equations with a rotating black hole
- The cosmic string is a topological defect that is wrapped around the black hole

 # _Properties_
- Taub-NUT space has a number of interesting properties, including:

+ It has a naked singularity, which means that the geometry of the space is not smooth at the center of the black hole

+ It has a cosmic string, which is a topological defect that can affect the behavior of matter and energy in the space

+ It has a rotating black hole, which means that the space is rotating around its axis of symmetry

- Taub-NUT space has been used to study a number of phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology, including:

+ The behavior of black holes and cosmic strings in the early universe

+ The properties of gravitational waves emitted by rotating black holes

+ The effects of cosmic strings on the large-scale structure of the universe
