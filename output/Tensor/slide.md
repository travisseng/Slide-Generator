 # Definition

- Tensors are multidimensional arrays of numbers that describe linear relationships between sets of geometric objects, such as vectors and scalars.

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # As Multidimensional Arrays
- Tensors can be thought of as generalizations of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions.
- They are often represented as tables of numbers with the same number of rows as columns.

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **As Multilinear Maps**

- Tensors can also be viewed as multilinear maps that take multiple inputs and produce a single output.
- This perspective is useful for understanding tensor operations and applications.

 # Using Tensor Products

- The tensor product is a way of combining two or more tensors into a new tensor.
- It is used extensively in many areas of physics and mathematics.

 # Tensors in Infinite Dimensions

- Tensors can be defined in infinite dimensions, allowing for the description of geometric objects with an infinite number of degrees of freedom.
- This is useful for understanding certain types of manifolds and their properties.

 # Tensor Fields

- A tensor field is a tensor that is defined on a manifold and describes a physical quantity that varies smoothly over the manifold.
- Examples include the metric tensor and the Christoffel symbols.

 # Einstein Summation Convention
- The Einstein summation convention is a way of simplifying tensor expressions by implying that indices that are repeated in a sum are contracted.
- This can make certain calculations much simpler and more intuitive.
