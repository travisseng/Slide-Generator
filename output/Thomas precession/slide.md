 # Thomas precession

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.88em}</style>

 # History

- Thomas precession was first proposed by Sir George Gabriel Stokes in 1852
- Named after William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who independently derived the equation in 1867
- Also known as the "Thomson-Stokes precession" or "Kelvin precession"

 # Introduction

- Thomas precession is a phenomenon where a rotating body's axis of rotation appears to precess (wobble) due to the effects of gravity and the body's angular momentum
- Precession is a slow, gradual motion that occurs over a long period of time
- Thomas precession is a fundamental concept in physics and astronomy, with applications in many fields

 # _Definition_
- Thomas precession is defined as the precession of a rotating body's axis of rotation due to the gravitational interaction with another body
- The equation for Thomas precession is given by:

$$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\frac{Gm}{r^3}\sin\theta$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the rotating body's axis of rotation and the line connecting the two bodies, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m$ is the mass of the other body, $r$ is the distance between the two bodies, and $t$ is time

 # Statement
- The equation for Thomas precession describes how the rotating body's axis of rotation changes over time due to the gravitational interaction with another body
- The precession motion is slow and gradual, and it can be observed in many astronomical systems, such as binary star systems and planetary rings

 # **Mathematical Explanation**
- The equation for Thomas precession can be derived using the principles of classical mechanics and the law of universal gravitation
- The equation takes into account the gravitational force between the two bodies, the rotational kinetic energy of the rotating body, and the angular momentum of the system

 # **Lorentz Transformations**
- In special relativity, the Lorentz transformations describe how space and time are affected by an object's velocity
- The Lorentz transformations can be used to derive the equation for Thomas precession in a more general context

 # _Extracting the Formula_

- To extract the formula for Thomas precession from the Lorentz transformations, we can use the following approach:

1. Define the position and velocity of the rotating body relative to the other body

2. Use the Lorentz transformations to determine the change in the rotating body's position and velocity over time

3. Use the law of conservation of angular momentum to determine the precession motion of the rotating body's axis of rotation

 # Applications

- Thomas precession has many applications in astronomy, including the study of binary star systems, planetary rings, and the dynamics of celestial bodies in the vicinity of black holes
- It is also used in geophysics to study the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation due to the gravitational interaction with the Moon and the Sun

 # In Electron Orbitals

- Thomas precession can be observed in the motion of electrons in atomic orbitals, particularly in the case of hydrogen-like atoms
- The precession motion is caused by the gravitational interaction between the electron and the nucleus, and it leads to a small difference in the energy levels of the electrons

 # In a Foucault Pendulum
- A Foucault pendulum is a device used to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth
- The pendulum's axis of rotation appears to precess due to the gravitational interaction with the Earth, and this precession motion can be observed over time
