 # _Time dilation_

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # History

- Time dilation was first proposed by Albert Einstein in his theory of special relativity (1905)
- It was later experimentally confirmed and has since been a fundamental concept in modern physics

 # **Time Dilation caused by Relative Velocity**

- When an object moves at high speeds, time passes more slowly for the observer on the moving object relative to a stationary observer
- This effect is known as time dilation and is a consequence of special relativity

 # Simple Inference
<div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; flex-flow: row; min-height: 0"><div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; justify-content: center;min-height:0;min-width:0; margin-bottom:0.1em;;margin-right:0.15em">
<img style='object-fit: contain; max-height:100%; max-width:100%; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Time-dilation-002-mod.svg/660px-Time-dilation-002-mod.svg.png'/>
</div>
</div>

- If two observers are moving relative to each other, they will both experience time passing differently
- This leads to the simple inference that time is not absolute, but rather depends on the observer's frame of reference

 # Reciprocity
<div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; flex-flow: row; min-height: 0"><div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; justify-content: center;min-height:0;min-width:0; margin-bottom:0.1em;;margin-right:0.15em">
<img style='object-fit: contain; max-height:100%; max-width:100%; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Eigenzeit.svg/220px-Eigenzeit.svg.png'/>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; justify-content: center;min-height:0;min-width:0; margin-bottom:0.1em;;margin-right:0.15em">
<img style='object-fit: contain; max-height:100%; max-width:100%; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Time_dilation02.gif/220px-Time_dilation02.gif'/>
</div>
</div>

- Time dilation is a reciprocal effect, meaning that if one observer is moving relative to another, then the second observer will also experience time dilation in the opposite direction

 # _Experimental Testing_
- Time dilation has been experimentally confirmed through numerous experiments, including those using high-speed cameras and particle accelerators
- These experiments have consistently shown that time passes more slowly for moving objects relative to stationary ones


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # **Doppler Effect**
- The Doppler effect is a related concept in which the frequency of light emitted by a moving object changes as it moves relative to an observer
- This effect is often used as a proxy for time dilation in experiments


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Moving Particles
- Time dilation also applies to particles that are accelerated or decelerated, such as in particle accelerators
- This leads to the concept of proper time, which is the time experienced by an observer in their own frame of reference

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # _Minkowski Diagram_

- The Minkowski diagram is a geometric representation of spacetime that shows how time and space are intertwined
- It is used to visualize and understand the effects of time dilation and other relativistic phenomena

<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

<div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; flex-flow: row; min-height: 0"><div style="display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto; justify-content: center;min-height:0;min-width:0; margin-bottom:0.1em;;margin-right:0.15em">

<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Time dilation can be derived from the theory of special relativity using mathematical techniques such as the Lorentz transformation
- The formula for time dilation is: t = Î³(t') where t is the time experienced by an observer in their own frame of reference, and t' is the time experienced by an observer in a stationary frame of reference

 # Hyperbolic Motion
- Time dilation also applies to objects moving in hyperbolic trajectories, such as comets or spacecraft
- This leads to the concept of hyperbolic motion and the idea that time can be dilated for objects moving at high speeds


---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Clock Hypothesis
- The clock hypothesis states that time dilation is equivalent to the passage of time being slower for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer
- This concept has important implications for our understanding of time and the universe

 # _Time Dilation caused by Gravity or Acceleration_
- Time dilation also occurs in the presence of strong gravitational fields or during acceleration, such as in the vicinity of black holes or neutron stars
- This effect is known as gravitational time dilation and is a consequence of general relativity

 # Experimental Testing (Continued)

- Combined effect of velocity and gravitational time dilation has been experimentally confirmed through numerous experiments, including those using high-precision atomic clocks and gravitational wave detectors
- These experiments have consistently shown that time passes more slowly for objects in strong gravitational fields or during acceleration
