 # Antiquity

- Early philosophical ideas about matter and energy, e.g. Aristotle's concept of the four elements (earth, air, fire, water)
- Early understandings of gravity and the nature of the universe, e.g. ancient Greek idea of a geocentric universe with Earth at its center

 # Early Middle Ages
- Development of medieval scholasticism, including the works of Thomas Aquinas on natural philosophy and the nature of God
- The rise of Islamic science and mathematics, which contributed to the development of physics in the Middle Ages

 # 16th century
- The Scientific Revolution, marked by the work of Copernicus (heliocentrism), Galileo (telescope, motion of objects on Earth and in heavens), and Kepler (laws of planetary motion)
- The invention of the printing press, which facilitated the dissemination of scientific ideas and theories

 # 20th century
- The rise of modern physics, marked by the discoveries of quantum mechanics, relativity, and the atomic bomb
- Major figures such as Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, and Schr√∂dinger, who shaped our understanding of the universe at the atomic and subatomic level
- The development of particle accelerators and other technologies that allowed for the study of high-energy physics and the discovery of new particles and forces

 # 21st century
- Ongoing advances in particle physics, including the discovery of the Higgs boson and the search for dark matter and dark energy
- The rise of cosmology as a distinct field of study, with major discoveries such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe
- The development of new technologies such as supercomputers, advanced telescopes, and particle detectors that allow for ever more precise measurements and observations in physics.

I hope this timeline helps you understand the historical context of some of the major discoveries in fundamental physics!
