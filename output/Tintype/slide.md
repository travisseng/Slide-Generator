 # History
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Invented by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1841 as a way to produce positive images without the need for a printing process
- Became popular in the late 1800s as a means of producing affordable, mass-produced photographs
- Decline in popularity around the early 20th century with the advent of other photographic processes such as gelatin dry plates

 # Ambrotype as a Precursor

- Ambrotype was an earlier photographic process that involved using a glass plate coated with a light-sensitive solution to produce a positive image
- The ambrotype process was more expensive and time-consuming than the tintype process, but produced higher quality images
- The tintype process was seen as an improvement over the ambrotype process because it was cheaper and easier to use

 # **Ferrotyping**

- Ferrotyping is a variant of the tintype process that involves using a ferric oxide solution instead of collodion
- Produces a more stable and durable image than traditional tintypes
- Has been used by some photographers to create unique and experimental images
