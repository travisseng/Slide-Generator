 # **Lomography**


"Lomography, a style of photography that emerged in the early 1990s, is characterized by its use of low-end, plastic cameras with simple lenses and film. The movement was founded by Austrian students who rediscovered an old Russian camera called the LOMO LC-A, and it quickly gained popularity for its nostalgic and artistic aesthetic."
