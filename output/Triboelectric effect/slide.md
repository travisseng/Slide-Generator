 # **Triboelectric effect**

 # Introduction to Triboelectric Effect
- Definition: Triboelectric effect is the transfer of electrons between two materials in contact due to friction or other mechanical forces.
- Also known as triboelectrification.

 # Triboelectric Series
- A series of materials with varying degrees of triboelectricity, from most to least electronegative:

+ Rubber (most electronegative)

+ Plastic (less electronegative)

+ Metal (least electronegative)

 # Cause of Triboelectric Effect
- Friction between two materials with different electronegativity can cause electrons to be transferred from one material to another.
- The degree of triboelectrification depends on the surface area in contact, the force applied, and the duration of friction.

 # Sparks
- When two materials with a high degree of triboelectricity are brought into contact, sparks can occur due to the transfer of electrons.
- This can be seen in everyday life when rubbing a balloon against hair or clothing to create static electricity.

 # Mechanism of Triboelectrification
- The triboelectric effect is caused by the transfer of electrons between two materials due to the difference in electronegativity.
- When one material gains electrons, the other material loses electrons.
