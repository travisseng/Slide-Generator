- Ultraviolet (UV) photography is a specialized form of photography that uses ultraviolet light to capture images
- UV light has a shorter wavelength than visible light, and is not visible to the human eye
- UV photography can reveal details and patterns that are not visible in visible light photographs

 # Equipment and Techniques
- Specialized cameras with UV sensors or filters are used for UV photography
- UV lenses are available for standard cameras, but they can be expensive and may require additional adjustments to the camera settings
- Proper exposure and white balance settings are crucial for capturing high-quality UV images

 # Reflected UV Photography
- Reflected UV photography involves using a reflector or flash to bounce UV light onto the subject
- This technique can be used to create detailed, high-contrast images of objects and textures
- Reflected UV photography can be used in product photography, still life photography, and other applications where detailed imaging is important

- UV induced fluorescence photography involves using UV light to excite fluorescent molecules in the subject, causing them to emit light at a different wavelength
- This technique can be used to create vibrant, colorful images of objects and materials that do not naturally fluoresce under visible light
- UV induced fluorescence photography is commonly used in forensic science, biomedical imaging, and other applications where the properties of materials need to be analyzed
