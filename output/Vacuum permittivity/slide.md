 # Vacuum permittivity

<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.92em}</style>

 # Value

- Vacuum permittivity (ε0) is a fundamental constant of nature that describes the ability of a medium to support an electric field
- It is defined as the inverse of the electric constant (C) and is expressed in units of Farads per meter (F/m)

 # Redefinition of the SI Units
- In 2019, the International System of Units (SI) underwent a redefinition that affected several fundamental constants, including ε0
- The new definition of ε0 is based on the speed of light and the Planck constant, and is expressed in units of Coulombs per meter (C/m)

 # Terminology
- Vacuum permittivity is also known as the "permeability of free space" or "magnetic permeability of vacuum"
- The symbol ε0 is often used to represent vacuum permittivity, while the symbol μ0 is used to represent the magnetic permeability of vacuum

 # _Historical Origin of the Parameter ε0_

- Vacuum permittivity was first introduced by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century as part of his theory of electromagnetism
- Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact with matter, and include the equation ∇⋅E = ρ/ε0, where E is the electric field strength and ρ is the charge density

 # Rationalization of Units
- The unit of vacuum permittivity has been redefined several times throughout history, based on changing understanding of the nature of electricity and magnetism
- The current definition of ε0 is based on the most accurate measurements and theories of the fundamental constants of nature

 # Determination of a Value for ε0
- Vacuum permittivity has been measured in several ways, including using electromagnetic waves, charged particles, and quantum fields
- The currently accepted value of ε0 is approximately 8.85 x 10^-12 F/m, based on measurements and calculations using the most advanced techniques and technologies

 # Permittivity of Real Media
- In contrast to vacuum permittivity, the permittivity of real media such as solids and liquids is typically much lower, due to the presence of charged particles and defects in the material structure
- The permittivity of a material can be determined by measuring its dielectric constant, which is a measure of how much the material concentrates an electric field
