 # **Genuine Paradox**
- Explanation of the genuine paradox associated with Van Stockum dust, which is that the dust particles can move in a way that seems to violate the conservation of angular momentum
- Discussion of how this phenomenon can be understood using more advanced mathematical techniques, such as the use of frames and the consideration of non-conservative forces
