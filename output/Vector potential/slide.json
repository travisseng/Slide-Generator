By solving for the vector potential, we can determine the magnetic field at any point in space. This has many practical applications, such as designing electrical power systems and understanding electromagnetic induction. For example, in an AC circuit, the vector potential is used to calculate the magnetic field around the wires and the iron core of a transformer.\""}, [], {"page_nb": 3}]}, {"slide": [{"title": "Theorem"}, [], {"text": "\"Faraday's law of induction states that the changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a closed loop. This law can be used to derive the equation for vector potential. The theorem is based on the idea that the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through a surface enclosed by a loop is proportional to the electric current flowing through the loop. This relationship between the changing magnetic field and the electric current is the basis for many electrical devices, such as generators and motors.\""}, {"page_nb": 4}]}, {"slide": [{"title": "Nonuniqueness"}, [], {"text": "\"Unfortunately, the vector potential is not unique, meaning that there are multiple possible solutions to the equation. This nonuniqueness can be resolved by choosing a specific gauge, such as the Coulomb gauge. The gauge choice affects the form of the solution, but not the physical content of the theory. In other words, different gauges describe the same physical phenomena, but with different mathematical forms. This is an important aspect of quantum field theory and particle physics, where gauge invariance is a fundamental principle.\""}, {"page_nb": 5}]}, {"slide": [{"title": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "\"In conclusion, vector potential is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering that describes the magnetic field of a circuit or system.
