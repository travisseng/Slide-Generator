 # Virtual particle

---
<style scoped>p,li {font-size:0.96em}</style>

 # Introduction
- Virtual particles are not directly observable, but they play a crucial role in quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics.


---

 # Properties
- Virtual particles have the same properties as real particles, such as spin, charge, and mass.
- However, they are distinguishable from real particles by their lifetime and decay rate.

 # **Manifestations**

- Virtual particles can be seen in scattering experiments, where they appear as temporary exchange particles that mediate the interaction between real particles.
- They can also be observed in decays of unstable particles, where they are produced in pairs.

 # Feynman Diagrams
<div style='flex:1 1 auto; min-height:0;' class="grid grid-cols-8 gap-4">
<div style='display:flex; flex-flow:column; min-height:0;' class="col-span-4">

- Feynman diagrams are a graphical representation of particle interactions, which include virtual particles as internal lines.
- These diagrams are used to calculate scattering amplitudes and cross sections, which can be compared to experimental results.

 # **Vacuums**

- Virtual particles can be thought of as "excitations" of the vacuum, which is the quantum state of the universe when no real particles are present.
- The vacuum is not completely empty, but rather a sea of virtual particles and antiparticles that are constantly fluctuating.

 # Pair Production
- Virtual particles can be produced in pairs through the interaction with real particles.
- This process is known as pair production, and it is an important mechanism for creating particle-antiparticle pairs in high-energy collisions.

 # Compared to Actual Particles

- Virtual particles are similar to actual particles in terms of their properties, but they have some key differences.
- For example, virtual particles have a much shorter lifetime than real particles, and they can be observed only in specific contexts.

 # Footnotes
- Virtual particles are an essential part of quantum field theory and the Standard Model, but they are not directly observable.
- They play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fundamental particles and their interactions.

I hope this presentation helps to provide a comprehensive overview of virtual particles! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
