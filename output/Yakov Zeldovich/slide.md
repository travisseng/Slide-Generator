 # **Black Hole Thermodynamics**

- Zeldovich is perhaps best known for his work on black hole thermodynamics, which he developed in collaboration with his colleagues Alexei Starobinsky and Igor Novikov.
- This theory posits that black holes have a temperature and entropy, and that they can be described using the principles of thermodynamics.
